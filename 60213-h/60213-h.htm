<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> task of writing an account of the cathedral of Notre
Dame is materially lightened by the minute details of its
history and architecture to be found in the various writings
of M. Viollet-le-Duc, of which, unfortunately, the Library
of the British Museum does not contain a complete set.
The <i>Description de Notre Dame</i>, published in 1856 by
M. de Guilhermy in conjunction with M. Viollet-le-Duc,
contains much useful material, while the splendidly illustrated
account of the church in the first volume of <i>Paris à travers
les Ages</i> is full of interesting archæological particulars. As
the numerous other authorities which have been used are
quoted in the text, it is unnecessary to enumerate them here.
The writer has found Mr. Charles Herbert Moore’s <i>Development
of Gothic Architecture</i> useful in not a few difficult
matters. He wishes specially to thank Mr. Edward Bell for
valuable suggestions on many important points.</p>

<span>A BRIEF HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE CATHEDRAL.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">No</span> city of the modern world has seen such amazing changes
as the French metropolis. In the eyes of many persons,
from every downfall Paris has arisen more incontestably
splendid. But not to all is the Paris of Baron Hausmann
lovelier than the city which preceded it. For instance, M.
Joris-Karl Huysmans, the author at once modern and mystical
of <i>A Rebours</i> and <i>La Cathédrale</i>, bitterly regrets the disappearance
of those ancient and brooding byways which lent
to the Paris of his youth a curious charm which has now
almost disappeared. The Paris of magnificent vistas is at
least less fascinating to the artist than the comparatively
provincial city of crooked lanes which has gone to make
way for a series of lofty and pretentious street fronts and
spacious squares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>Strange it is that, where so much has been changed, the
cathedral church of Notre Dame has remained almost unaltered
in outline and general effect. Revolutions have surged round
it; monstrous rites have been perpetrated within it; even the
hail of shot and shell have left this wonderful Gothic creation
poorer only in decorative detail. There is a certain fascination
in the grimness of this mysterious building in <i>la ville lumière</i>,
and I am disposed to agree with Mr. Richard Whiteing that it
symbolises the underlying sadness, as opposed to the superficial
gaiety of the Parisian. Thousands of French churches
are dedicated to Notre Dame: even in Paris itself we have
Notre Dame de l’Assomption, Notre Dame de l’Abbaye aux
Bois, Notre Dame des Blancs-Manteaux, Notre Dame des
Champs, Notre Dame de Lorette, and Notre Dame des
Victoires. But still when we speak of Notre Dame we allude
instinctively to that vast edifice which frowns over the slow
and winding Seine. The cathedral church of Notre Dame
is almost as closely connected with the history of the French
people as is the Abbey of Westminster with that of the
English. And indeed the gray-white building whose foundations
are nearly washed by the waters of the Seine has seen
pageants more superb, and tragedies more luridly dramatic,
<a name="than" id="than"></a><ins title="Original has 'that'">than</ins>
our own proud Minster of the West. Although it can
boast no such marvellous continuity of vital historic episodes,
Notre Dame is the one building in the French metropolis
which seems to stand as a symbol for the whole city in all
its memorable phases: with it may not be compared the
bragging grandeur of the Arc de Triomphe, the extensive
splendour of the Louvre, nor the rebuilt Hôtel de Ville.
We do not forget the exquisite beauties of La Sainte Chapelle,
the strange fascination of the resting-place of the Great
Napoleon, nor the majesty of the once royal church of Saint
Denis. None of these, however, will bear serious comparison
with the great Metropolitan Cathedral of Paris. Notre Dame
has an almost unearthly power of asserting its existence.
Neither in full sunshine, nor in the twilight, nor when night
has finally set in, will it allow its majestic proportions to be
overlooked. Mr. Henley has finely spoken of “the high
majesty of Paul’s,” but even our own metropolitan cathedral,
with its overwhelming dome, is scarcely more predominant
than Notre Dame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>The geographical position of the Cathedral of Paris is not
unlike that anciently possessed by Westminster Abbey, and
by that crown of the Fens, Ely Cathedral. We find that
Notre Dame dominates an islet of the Seine. At its east
end is that tragical commentary on the life of modern Paris,
The Morgue. The late Mr. Grant Allen, with a cheerfulness
which we are far from sharing, noted that this triumphant
example of the best Gothic in the world has often been
restored. We believe that he was one of many intelligent
persons who derive a real satisfaction from the so-called
“restoration” of an ancient work, of which no real “restoration”
is possible, though repair is an obvious duty.</p>

<p>The mediæval churches of western Europe nearly all claim a
pre-Christian origin. It is charming to the mind of a certain
type of antiquary to discover the origin of a Christian cathedral
in the wreck of a Roman temple. For Westminster Abbey
and for St. Paul’s Roman foundations have, with more or less
accuracy, been described. In the case of Notre Dame it is
certain that the remains of an altar of Jupiter were discovered
in 1711, which would seem to indicate that a pagan temple
once stood on or near the site in the Gaulish city of Lutetia
Parisiorum. In point of fact, it is a matter of no small difficulty
to make out clearly the origin of Notre Dame, or to describe
with certainty the ecclesiastical buildings which in the dim
past occupied its site. A lady writer who has discussed the
church with much intelligence writes on this matter as follows:<a name="FNanchor-1" id="FNanchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1">[1]</a></p>

<p>“The origin of Notre Dame is enveloped in mystery.
Whether its first bishop, St. Denis, or Dionysius, was the
Areopagite converted by St. Paul’s preaching at Athens, and
sent by St. Clement to preach the Gospel to the Parisians,
or whether he was another personage of the same name who
was sent into Gaul in the third century and martyred during
the persecutions under Decius, it is impossible to say, as there
is no evidence of any value. Certain it is, however, that the
first bishop of Paris bore the name of Denis, and that he
suffered martyrdom, with his two companions Rusticus and
Eleutherius, on the summit of the hill now called Montmartre.
Tradition went so far as to point out the spot where they first
gathered their followers together&mdash;the crypt of Notre Dame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
des Champs; also the prison where our Lord appeared to
them and strengthened them with His Holy Body and Blood
at St. Denis de la Chartre; the place, at St. Denis du Pas,
where they suffered their first tortures; and lastly, Montmartre,
where they were beheaded. But, with the exception of the
latter, all these holy spots have disappeared. So, too, have
the crosses which marked the route taken by the Saint, when
he carried his head to the place chosen for his burial, at
St. Denis. An ancient church covered the remains of the
three saints until the present splendid building was erected,
in the reign of Dagobert I. Under the Roman dominion,
Paris was comprised in the fourth Lyonnaise division, of which
Sens was the metropolis. Hence the bishops of Paris acknowledged
the Archbishop of Sens as their primate until
1622, when, at the request of Louis XIII., Pope Gregory XV.
raised Paris to the see of an archbishopric. The succession
has consisted of one hundred and nine bishops and fifteen
archbishops, eight of whom have been raised to the dignity
of Cardinal. Besides St. Denis six have been venerated as
Saints: Marcel, in the fifth century; Germain, in the sixth
century; Ceran, Landry, and Agilbert in the seventh, and
Hugues in the eighth century.”</p>

<p>We must leave this ancient and hazy story of saints and
martyrs, and return to the thorny question of the origin of
the cathedral. From the brief account of Notre Dame by Mr.
A. J. C. Hare in his entertaining volume on Paris, we glean
that about the year 375 a church, dedicated to St. Stephen
(St. Etienne), was built on the islet under Prudentius, eighth
bishop of Paris. “In 528,” says Mr. Hare, “through the
gratitude of Childebert&mdash;‘<i>le nouveau Melchisedech</i>’&mdash;for his
recovery from a sickness by St. Germain, another far more rich
and beautiful edifice (dedicated to Sainte Marie&mdash;) arose by the
side of the first church, and was destined to become <i>ecclesia
parisiaca</i>, the cathedral of Paris. Childebert endowed it with
three estates&mdash;at Chelles-en-Brie, at La Celle near Monterau,
and at La Celle near Fréjus&mdash;which last supplied the oil for
its sacred ordinances. The new church had not long been
finished when La Cité, in which the monks of S. Germain had
taken refuge with their treasures, was besieged by the
Normans; but it was successfully defended by Bishop Gozlin,
who died during the siege. It is believed that the substructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
of this church were found during recent excavations
in the Parvis Notre Dame,<a name="FNanchor-2" id="FNanchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2">[2]</a> and architectural fragments then
discovered are now preserved at the Palais des Thermes.”
It may be taken for granted that Childebert’s church took
the form of a Roman basilica, and it is probable that Roman
materials were used in its construction. In 1847 further
Roman remains were discovered on the site which doubtless
formed part of Childebert’s building. Some of them are
preserved at the Hôtel-Cluny.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote-2" id="Footnote-2"></a><a title="Return to text" href="#FNanchor-2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The space to the west of the church was called <i>Parvis paradisus</i>, the
earthly paradise leading by the celestial Jerusalem.</p>
</div>

<p>I am, however, inclined to agree with M. de Guilhermy and
M. Viollet-le-Duc,<a name="FNanchor-3" id="FNanchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3">[3]</a> that the story of the cathedral previous to
the episcopacy of Bishop Maurice de Sully (1160&ndash;96) is, if
not absolutely fictitious, at least merely conjectural.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote-3" id="Footnote-3"></a><a title="Return to text" href="#FNanchor-3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> See <i>Description de Notre-Dame,
<a name="Cathedrale" id="Cathedrale"></a><ins title="Original has 'Cathédral'">Cathédrale</ins> de Paris</i>: Paris, 1856.
The main points of Viollet-le-Duc’s inventory of the cathedral will be
found in Queyron’s <i>Histoire et Description de l’Eglise de Notre Dame</i>,
Paris: E. Plon, Nourrit et C<sup>ie</sup>.</p>
</div>

<p>This prelate&mdash;generally counted as the sixty-second occupant
of the see&mdash;seems at first to have united the adjacent churches
of St. Stephen and St<sup>e</sup> Marie on the Ile de la Cité, and then
(without immediately and totally destroying them) to have
commenced a new one on the same site, of which Pope
Alexander III. laid the foundation-stone in 1163. Rapid
progress must have been made with the work, for it is certain
that in 1185 Heraclitus, patriarch of Jerusalem, officiated at
the altar, in front of which, in the year following, Geoffrey,
Count of Brittany, son of Henry II. of England, was buried.
Maurice de Sully provided for the continuation of the work
after his death, which took place in 1196. By his will he left
five thousand <i>livres</i> in order that the choir might be roofed
with lead. At this time, according to Viollet-le-Duc, considerable
progress must have been made with the nave. Maurice
de Sully was succeeded by Eudes de Sully (1197&ndash;1208), on
whose death the see was occupied, until 1219, by Pierre de
Nemours. Towards 1223 the west front was completed to
the base of the great gallery, and by 1235 the towers were
left much as we see them to-day. The spires, which it is
generally admitted they were intended to carry, were never
added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>Between the years 1235 and 1240, a fire seems to have
broken out at Notre Dame. On this subject history is silent,
but that it did serious damage is maintained by Viollet-le-Duc
on what appear to be sufficient grounds. According to him,
repair was made in haste, so that rose windows, flying
buttresses and other structural details were ruthlessly sacrificed.
The west front seems to have escaped mutilation. Up to 1245
the cathedral, vast as was its area, possessed either no chapels
at all, or chapels of inconsiderable dimensions. In that year,
however, the addition of new chapels was proceeded with. It
would appear that, shortly after, the plainness of the transept
fronts in comparison with the splendidly decorated west façade
was acutely felt. In 1257, Jean de Chelles was engaged on
reconstructing the southern doorway. At this time St. Louis
was King of France, and Renaud de Corbeil bishop of Paris.
The northern door and the chapels next the transepts on
either side were altered immediately after the southern
entrance. In 1351, Jean Ravy and Jean de Bouteiller were
engaged about the cathedral as sculptors.</p>

<p>During the next three centuries Notre Dame escaped anything
in the nature of important change, destruction or addition;
but in 1699 an era of reckless mutilation began. Between
the last-named date and 1753 the Cloister, the stalls of the
sixteenth century, the old high altar, many sepulchral monuments,
and a vast quantity of stained glass were destroyed.
The work done in the names of “repair” and “beautification”
deprived the cathedral of mouldings, foliated capitals, gargoyles
and pinnacles. The damage inflicted by the architect Soufflot
(who designed the Panthéon) will be noticed later. Towards
the end of Louis XV.’s reign the church was refloored with
squares of marble. The new pavement involved the tearing
up of a number of curious tombstones, some of which covered
the dust of men greatly distinguished in French history.
Between 1773 and 1787 minor alterations in the taste of the
time were made in various parts of the building, but further
additions were brought to an end by the outbreak of the
Revolution. That any sculpture of a religious or royal
character was spared at Notre Dame during that terrific
upheaval seems to have been due to the eloquence of Citoyen
Chaumette and the influence of Citoyen Dupuis. Of the
great work of repair and addition performed by the architects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Viollet-le-Duc and Lassus, their assistants and successors, much
will be said when we consider the cathedral in detail.</p>

<p>We have already discussed the early story of Notre Dame,
and noted the vicissitudes through which the fabric has
passed. I propose, before concluding this introductory chapter,
to state in the briefest possible way the great historical events
with which the cathedral is connected, from the death, in
1196, of Maurice de Sully to the present time.</p>

<p>From the tenth century up to the end of the fifteenth
century the extraordinary <i>Fête des Fous</i> was celebrated in
Notre Dame. One of the cathedral employés was elected
<i>Evêque des Fous</i>, and, wearing the actual vestments used
in religious services, was honoured with a great banquet
accompanied with grotesque dances and songs. This orgy
took place in the church itself, and was so popular that it
flourished in spite of the most determined efforts to suppress
it. A similar custom was observed in La Sainte Chapelle.
During the early years of the thirteenth century the Dominican
order was established. St. Dominic himself preached once
at least in Notre Dame. During his prayer before the
sermon, the Virgin is said to have appeared to him in a
cloud of light and to have given to him a book containing
the subject-matter of his discourse. Raymond VII., Count
of Toulouse, underwent the discipline of the lash for heresy
before the door of the cathedral in 1229. This spot was
for centuries occupied by a pillory. From 1220 onwards
a series of disputes took place between the officials of the
church and the university. During the long reign of St.
Louis, which ended in 1271, the power of the bishop and
chapter of Paris had increased enormously, and a host of
vassals did homage to Bishop Etienne II. for their lands.
The body of St. Louis was laid in state in Notre Dame
previous to its burial at St. Denis. This custom was
followed in the case of many other French monarchs and
princes of the blood.</p>

<p>On April 10th, 1302, Philippe-le-Bel held the first meeting
of the States-general in the cathedral. In the month of
June, 1389, Isabeau de Bavière made a solemn entry into
Paris. Froissart tells us that: “Devant ladite église de
Notre-Dame, en la place, l’évêque de Paris étoit revêtu des
armes de Notre-Seigneur et tout le collège. Aussi on moult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
avoit grand clergé et la descendit la royne et la mirent hors
de sa litière les quatre ducs qui là estoyent, Berry, Bourgogne,
Touraine et Bourbon.... La royne de France fut adestrée
et menée parmy l’église et le chœur jusqu’au grand autel et la
se mit <a name="lower-a" id="lower-a"></a><ins title="Original has 'A'">à</ins>
genoux et fit ses oraisons ainsi que bon lui sembla,
et bailla et offrit à la trésorerie de Notre-Dame quatre draps
d’or et la belle couronne que les anges lui avoient posée sur la
porte de Paris.”</p>

<p>A great thanksgiving service was held when Charles VI.
had been saved from burning. The King, it may be recalled,
was dressed as a satyr at a palace fête with five companions.
The Duke of Orleans was curious as to the identity of the
disguised, and approached them with a torch, which accidentally
set their clothing alight. The King was saved by the Duchess
de Berri, who threw a cloak over him, but four of his companions
were burned to death.</p>

<p>We must now turn to the time of Henry V. of England,
who, after Agincourt, became Regent of France with the
right of succession to the throne. After his marriage with
Catherine, daughter of Charles VI., in 1420, he paid a
solemn state visit to Notre Dame. On Henry’s death his
son, afterwards Henry VI., was crowned King of France in
the cathedral. When the English were driven from Rouen,
a great service of thanksgiving was held to celebrate the
entry of Charles VII. into the Norman capital.</p>

<div class="caption">QUEEN MARIE ANTOINETTE RETURNING THANKS FOR THE BIRTH
OF A DAUPHIN, JANUARY 21ST, 1782.<br />
(<i>From “Paris à travers les Ages.”</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>“In the annals of Notre Dame,” says Mr. W. F. Lonergan
in his <i>Historic Churches of Paris</i>, “from the days of
Louis XI., the rebellious dauphin who succeeded his father,
Charles VII., to the reign of the fourteenth Louis, there is
chiefly a long record of <i>Te Deums</i> after the victories of the
French army. Historic Rheims, where Clovis had been
baptized by S. Remi in 496, was the favoured city of the
Merovingians, who had accorded it great privileges.” Amongst
these was the right of crowning and consecrating the Kings
of France. Save Henri Quatre and Louis XVIII., all of them
were crowned at Rheims; but it was the custom of the newly
made sovereigns to go in state to Notre Dame at Paris to
return thanks for their advent to the throne. Amongst the
most interesting of the historic events which took place in,
or were magnificently celebrated at Notre Dame, were the
following: the French victory over the Venetians at Agnadel
or, as the Italians call it, Vaila, in 1509; the marriage of
Louis XII. with Mary, sister of Henry VIII. of England;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
the victories of Francis I.; and the marriage of Mary Stuart
with the Dauphin. The marriage of Henri, King of Navarre,
with Marguerite de Valois, took place at the entrance to the
cathedral, as the King was a Protestant. In 1590 the
Catholic nobles swore at the altar of Notre Dame to fight
this same Henri to the bitter end. In 1593, however,
he became a Catholic, and attended mass at the cathedral
on the occasion of his accession to the throne as the first
monarch of the Bourbon line. The metropolitan see was
raised to the dignity of an archbishopric by Pope Gregory XV.
in 1622. In 1682, under Louis XIV., the great bell or
<i>bourdon</i> of the church was christened Emmanuel Louis
Thérèse, the King and Queen being the sponsors. Later on,
in 1699, the great changes in the church, undertaken in
fulfilment of the vow of Louis XIII., were begun. The first
stone of the new altar was laid by the Archbishop with the
utmost pomp. The foundation slab was inscribed: “Louis
the Great&mdash;son of Louis the Just&mdash;after he had suppressed
heresy, established the true faith in his kingdom, terminated
gloriously wars by land and sea, wishing to accomplish the
vow of his father, built this altar in the cathedral church
of Paris, dedicating it to the God of Arms, Master of Peace
and Victory, under the invocation of the Virgin, patron and
protector of his State, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1699.” During the reign of
the “Grand Monarque,” <i>Te Deums</i> were even more frequent
than before.</p>

<p>We come at length to the part played by the cathedral
during the Revolution. We need say nothing of the fate of
the fabric itself, for that has already been alluded to. Its
escape is little short of marvellous. The result of the sack of
the treasuries of the churches of Paris is best told in Carlyle’s
vivid translation of Mercier: “This, accordingly, is what the
streets of Paris saw: Most of these persons were still drunk,
with the brandy they had swallowed out of chalices;&mdash;eating
mackerel on the patenas! Mounted on Asses, which were
housed with Priests’ cloaks, they reined them with Priests’
stoles; they held clutched with the same hand communion-cup
and sacred wafer. They stopped at the doors of Dramshops;
held out ciboriums: and the landlord, stoup in hand,
had to fill them thrice. Next came Mules high laden with
crosses, chandeliers, censers, holy-water vessels, hyssops;&mdash;recalling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to mind the Priests of Cybele, whose panniers, filled
with the instruments of their worship, served at once as
storehouse, sacristy and temple.” On November 10th, 1793,
the Cult of Reason was decreed by the Convention, and Notre
Dame converted into the temple of the new religion. To
quote Carlyle again: “For the same day, while this brave
Carmagnole-dance has hardly jigged itself out, there arrive
Procureur Chaumette and Municipals and Departmentals, and
with them the strangest freightage: a New Religion! Demoiselle
Candeille, of the Opera; a woman fair to look upon, when
well rouged; she borne on palanquin shoulder high; with red
woollen nightcap; in azure mantle; garlanded with oak;
holding in her hand the Pike of the Jupiter-<i>Peuple</i>, sails in:
heralded by white young women girt in tricolor. Let the
world consider it! This, O National Convention, wonder of
the universe, is our New Divinity; <i>Goddess of Reason</i>, worthy,
and alone worthy of revering. Her henceforth we adore.
Nay, were it too much of an august National Representation
that it also went with us to the <i>ci-devant</i> Cathedral called of
Notre Dame, and executed a few strophes in worship of
her?... And now after due pause and flourishes of oratory,
the Convention, gathering its limbs, does get under way in
the required procession towards Notre Dame;&mdash;Reason, again
in her litter, sitting in the van of them, borne, as one judges,
by men in the Roman costume; escorted by wind-music, red
nightcaps, and the madness of the world. And so, straightway,
Reason taking seat on the high-altar of Notre Dame, the
requisite worship or quasi-worship is, say the Newspapers,
<i>executed</i>; National Convention chanting ‘the <i>Hymn to Liberty</i>,
words by Chénier, music by
<a name="Gossec" id="Gossec"></a><ins title="Original has 'Gossee'">Gossec</ins>.’
It is the first of the
<i>Feasts of Reason</i>; first communion-service of the New Religion
of Chaumette.” The real heroine of this orgy was probably
an opera dancer called Maillard. ‘Demoiselle Candeille’
was an actress and writer of some repute, who strenuously
denied that she ever had anything to do with the Feast
of Reason. An imitation “mountain” was erected in the
nave for the “fête,” on which was built a Gothic temple
inscribed <i>A la Philosophie</i>. Around were busts of famous
philosophers, and below an altar surmounted with the so-called
Torch of Truth. The goddess sat on the hill, hymns were sung
in her honour and vows of fidelity to her were taken. In 1794<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
the church was used as a bonded store for the wine seized in
the cellars of guillotined or outlawed Royalists. The month
of May in the same year saw the “Temple of Reason” turned
into that of the “Supreme Being,” for Robespierre persuaded
the Convention to sign a decree recognising “the consoling
principle of the Immortality of the Soul.” In 1795 Christian
worship was once more restored at Notre Dame. Nothing
of great importance happened to the church until the star
of Napoleon rose&mdash;until, indeed, the first Consul had become
Emperor.</p>

<p>Of all the magnificent ceremonies of which Notre Dame has
been the scene, the most splendid was the joint coronation of
Napoleon and Josephine in the winter of 1804. A full account
of it will be found in the <i>Mémoires de la Duchesse d’Abrantès</i>,
of which I quote a part, purposely leaving it in the original
French, as any translation would be comparatively colourless
and unpicturesque: “Le pape arriva le premier. Au moment
où il entra dans la basilique, le clergé entonna <i>Tu es Petrus</i>,
etc.; et ce chant grave et religieux fit une profonde impression
sur les assistants. Pie VII. avançait du fond de cette
église, avec un air à la fois majestueux et humble....
L’instant qui réunit peut-être le plus de regards sur les marches
de l’autel, fut celui où Joséphine reçut de l’empereur la
couronne et fut sacrée solennellement impératrice des Français.
Lorsqu’il fut temps pour elle de paraître activement dans le
grand drame, l’impératrice descendit du trône et s’avança vers
l’autel, où l’attendait l’empereur, suivie de ses dames du palais
et de tout son service d’honneur, et ayant son manteau porté
par la princesse Caroline, la princesse Julie, la princesse Elisa
et la princesse Louis.... Je vis tout ce que je viens de dire dans
les yeux de Napoléon. Il jouissait en regardant l’impératrice
s’avancer vers lui; et lorsqu’elle s’agenouilla ... lorsque les
larmes qu’elle ne pouvait retenir, roulèrent sur ses mains
jointes qu’elle élevait bien plus vers lui que vers Dieu, dans ce
moment où Napoléon, ou plutôt <i>Bonaparte</i>, était pour elle
sa véritable providence, alors il y eut entre ces deux êtres une
de ces minutes fugitives, unique dans toute une vie, et qui
comblent le vide de bien des années. L’empereur mit
une grâce parfaite à la
<a name="moindre" id="moindre"></a><ins title="Original has 'moinde'">moindre</ins>
des actions qu’il devait faire
pour accomplir la cérémonie. Mais ce fut surtout lorsqu’il
s’agit de couronner l’impératrice. Cette action devait être<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
accompli par l’empereur, qui,
<a name="apres" id="apres"></a><ins title="Original has 'apres'">après</ins>
avoir reçu la petite couronne
fermée et surmontée de la croix, qu’il fallait placer sur la tête
de Joséphine, devait la poser sur sa propre tête, puis la mettre
sur celle de l’impératrice. Il mit à ces deux mouvements
une lenteur gracieuse qui était remarquable. Mais lorsqu’il
en fut au moment de couronner enfin celle qui était pour
lui, selon un préjugé, son <i>étoile heureuse</i> il fut <i>coquet</i> pour elle,
si je puis dire le mot. Il arrangeait cette petite couronne
qui surmontait la diadème, en diamant, la plaçait, la déplaçait,
la remettait encore, il semblait qu’il voulût lui promettre que
cette couronne lui serait douce et
<a name="legere" id="legere"></a><ins title="Original has 'legère'">légère</ins>.”</p>

<p>Napoleon, on this occasion, hastily took his crown from
the Pope’s hands and placed it haughtily on his own head&mdash;a
proceeding which doubtless startled his Holiness. In May
1814 Louis XVIII. and his family attended mass at Notre
Dame after their entry into Paris. A great service was held
there in 1840, to celebrate the restoration of the remains of
Napoleon I. to French soil, while Archbishops Affre, Sibour
and Darboy, who died violent deaths, were commemorated
with fitting solemnities.</p>

<p>The marriage of Napoleon III. to Eugénie de Montijo,
Comtesse de Teba, on January 29th, 1853, was the occasion
of a great display of gorgeous pageantry at Notre Dame, as
was the baptism of the ill-fated Prince Imperial in 1857. The
Terrorists of 1871 robbed the treasury of the cathedral of
many valuable relics, but their intention to injure the fabric
itself was prevented by the timely arrival of troops. The
most notable ceremonies during the existence of the present
Republic have been the funeral service, in June 1894, for
President Carnot, assassinated in that year at Lyons, and
the splendid State funeral of Louis Pasteur in October 1895.</p>

<p>The great festivals of the Church are celebrated at Notre
Dame on a scale of almost unrivalled magnificence. On
Assumption Day, in particular, splendid music, wedded to the
most ornate ritual, produces an effect never to be forgotten.
The pulpit of the metropolitan cathedral has been occupied
by a succession of great preachers, amongst them Bossuet
and Bourdaloue, and the services and conferences are noted
throughout the Roman Catholic world. The Dominican
Lacordaire began in 1835 a series of majestic and picturesque
discourses, which earned for him the title <i>le Romantique de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Chaire</i>, and he has been described as filling as a preacher
the place occupied in literature by Victor Hugo and in painting
by Delacroix, H. Vernet, and Delaroche. In recent times
among the most popular pulpit orators have been the fiery
Jesuit Père Ravignan, Monseigneur d’Hulst, Père Monsabré,
and M. Hyacinthe Loyson, better known to fame as Père
Hyacinthe.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this is the merest outline of the wonderful
history of the Cathedral Church of Paris. If the columns of
Notre Dame could speak, they would&mdash;to adapt a phrase of
Viollet-le-Duc&mdash;be able to recount the history of France from
the time of Philip Augustus to our own day. It is therefore
natural that the whole French nation has for Notre Dame a
feeling of veneration and affection similar to that which is called
forth in English hearts by the Abbey Church of Westminster.

<span>THE PLACE OF NOTRE DAME IN THE DEVELOPMENT

Gothic<a name="FNanchor-4" id="FNanchor-4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4">[4]</a> is so important that I propose to devote a brief
chapter to it. The subject is essentially technical, but I will
endeavour to make it as easy of comprehension as possible.
The reader will doubtless ask himself what is the difference
between Gothic and the style which preceded it. The reply,
unfortunately, cannot consist of a dogmatic statement. The
subject is a great one, and only a few sentences of this handbook
may be devoted to it. I shall rely for the most part on
the materials for a definition of Gothic given by M. Viollet-le-Duc
in his <i>Dictionnaire Raisonné de l’Architecture Française</i>.
The question is one of essential structural peculiarity as
opposed to mere decorative
<a name="idiosyncrasy" id="idiosyncrasy"></a><ins title="Original has 'idiosyncracy'">idiosyncrasy</ins>. I am aware that
many English writers whose opinions are entitled to respect

which immediately preceded Gothic is known generically as
Romanesque. In Romanesque the system may be described
as one of inert stability: in Gothic the system is one of
scientifically calculated thrusts and counter-thrusts. It was
the affair of art to inform what one may call the mechanics
of the building with interest and beauty. There have been
many attempts to compromise the two systems, so that we
often find Romanesque features in obviously Gothic buildings.
Much will be said in subsequent pages of the vaulting of
Notre Dame. I would willingly have left this vexed question
alone, but were I so to do, this handbook would be little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
than a descriptive catalogue of objects of interest together with
some historical reminiscences. For the vaulting is of the
essence of the whole matter: compared with it the consideration
of mouldings and of ornament is relatively unimportant.
To put the matter plainly, the very existence of a Gothic
church depends upon the proper arrangement of what we may
call its mechanism&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> its vaulting, piers, buttresses and so
forth. The mechanics being duly devised, art steps in, and
renders the essential beautiful.<a name="FNanchor-5" id="FNanchor-5"></a><a href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote-4" id="Footnote-4"></a><a title="Return to text" href="#FNanchor-4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> French Gothic is here generally intended to convey the Gothic of the
Ile-de-France. The contemporary architecture of Normandy has a character
of its own, probably not less valuable than that of the Ile-de-France. But
it is different, and its differences have been dealt with in other handbooks
of this series.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote-5" id="Footnote-5"></a><a title="Return to text" href="#FNanchor-5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The difficulty of attributing mediæval work in any countries to particular
designers is generally recognised. I do not wish to imply, in the passage
to which this note has reference, that the mechanic and the artist were
of necessity separate people. Most often the plan was arranged by a
master-builder who himself superintended the scheme of decoration.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not at Paris that we can trace the first attempt to
break away from the principles of Romanesque: the first step
in the distinctly Gothic development of French architecture,
according to some recent authorities, is to be found in the
apse of the church of Morienval. Morienval is a Romanesque
church, but it has ribbed vaulting, of which there is no
earlier instance in France. At St. Germer-de-Fly we find
the first truly Gothic apse on a large scale ever constructed.
It belongs to the second quarter of the twelfth century. The
same church possesses a vaulted triforium which may fairly be
considered the forerunner of the far grander one at Paris.
Again, the now suburban church of St. Denis has double
aisles, which clearly foreshadow the noble arrangement which
exists at Paris, Amiens, and elsewhere. Many writers are
agreed in regarding St. Denis as the starting-point of French
Gothic.</p>

<p>Notre Dame was the first of the greater French cathedrals
in which Gothic principles of construction were logically
carried out.
<a name="The" id="The"></a><ins title="Original has 'Ths'">The</ins>
choir was begun, according to M. V. Mortet
in his <i>Etude Historique et Archéologique sur la Cathédrale de
Paris</i>, in the year 1163.<a name="FNanchor-6" id="FNanchor-6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6">[6]</a> The nave (with the exception of the
extreme west end) was completed about the year 1195. The
west façade was built in the early part of the thirteenth
century. Notre Dame is thus older than the cathedral of
Amiens, with which one naturally compares it. Amiens was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
built between the years 1220 and 1288, except the lower
stages of the west front, which were only completed towards
the end of the fourteenth century. The towers are a
“debased” addition. In England the work being done while
the older parts of Notre Dame were in course of erection was
transitional; the new style had by no means been fully
understood and put into practice. Perhaps we do not overstate
the case when we say that the <i>science</i> (as well as the
art) of Gothic found its first real expression on a large scale
in the Cathedral of Paris.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote-6" id="Footnote-6"></a><a title="Return to text" href="#FNanchor-6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> I give the dates assumed by M. V. Mortet and later writers as
well as those affixed by M. Viollet-le-Duc. It will be noticed that the
differences between them are not material.</p>
</div>

<p>A glance at the ground-plan of Notre Dame shows us how
widely it differs from that of our own great churches. First of
all we notice that not merely the nave, but the choir, possesses
double aisles&mdash;a feature which is lacking in English churches<a name="FNanchor-7" id="FNanchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7">[7]</a>
on so vast a scale as Canterbury, York, Ely or Peterborough.
The magnificence which the system of double aisles lends
to a great church need hardly be insisted upon. For a French
church the nave of Paris is long, consisting of ten bays. The
smaller Norman nave of Norwich possesses, however, no
less than fourteen bays. At Paris one is struck by the slight
projection of the transepts. In nearly all the greater
churches of England the transepts are of large proportions,
and frequently (as at Canterbury and Lincoln) we find two
pairs of transepts. The transepts at Notre Dame are without
aisles, and are so shallow that the church is only just
cruciform. Speaking of these transepts Professor Roger Smith
observes: “They do not project beyond the line of the side
walls, so that, although fairly well marked in the exterior and
interior of the building, they add nothing to its floor-space.”</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote-7" id="Footnote-7"></a><a title="Return to text" href="#FNanchor-7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Chichester, which is an early church, has double aisles; it is, however,
comparatively small, and can in no sense be compared with so immense a

<p>The east end of Notre Dame takes the form of a magnificent
semicircular apse,&mdash;a form assuredly the most appropriate
to a Gothic church. The square eastern termination, so
common in England, is rare amongst the larger churches of
the best period of French Gothic. “A more beautiful eastern
termination than the Gothic apse,” says Mr. Charles Herbert
Moore,<a name="FNanchor-8" id="FNanchor-8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8">[8]</a> “could hardly be conceived. No part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
edifice does more honour to the Gothic builders. The low
Romanesque apse, covered with the primitive semi-dome,
and enclosed with its simple wall, presented no constructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
difficulties, and produced no imposing effect. But the soaring
French <i>chevet</i>, with its many-celled vault, its arcaded stories,
its circling aisles and its radial chapels, taxed the utmost
inventive power, and entranced the eye of the beholder.” It
seems to me that throughout his study of Gothic Mr. Moore
is a little less than fair to the Romanesque builders. The
Gothic apse, which he so justly admires, is, after all, evolved
from the Romanesque apse, which he holds in such light
esteem. While we may admit the superiority of the Gothic
apse, it is going too far to assert that the Romanesque apse
“produces no imposing effect.” The apse of Norwich or
Peterborough, or of St. Bartholomew’s (London) is assuredly
imposing in a very high degree.</p>

</div>

<p>In a subsequent chapter the structural and decorative
details will be fully discussed. It may, however, be noted in
passing that, although the Cathedral of Paris is in all essentials
a Gothic building, the influence of the Romanesque style is
so marked in some of its details that it is frequently described
as a transitional structure. As we have seen, the greater
part of Notre Dame belongs to the twelfth century; and
De Caumont, who in his <i>Abécédaire</i> attempted for French
architecture a work of scientific division similar to that which
Rickman essayed for English architecture, describes French
work of the twelfth century as <i>Architecture Romane-Tertiaire
ou de Transition</i>. The <i>Abécédaire</i>, however, is now considered
ingenious rather than authoritative.</p>

<p>With a few words about the west front this brief chapter
must be concluded. The great façade of Notre Dame was
begun in 1202. It bears a general structural resemblance to
that of the cathedral of Senlis, which dates from the second
half of the twelfth century, especially in the matter of its
triple portals and the towers at the termination of the aisles.
At Senlis we have unmistakable evidence of the Gothic spirit,
but in its main plan this front is similar to the Romanesque
Abbaye-aux-Hommes at Caen. The builders of the west front
of Notre Dame thus owe something to the designers of Senlis
and the Abbaye-aux-Hommes, but they have achieved a
variety and symmetry of which their forerunners probably
did not dream. In construction, as well as in the organic
significance of its wealth of sculptured decoration, the façade
of Notre Dame is genuinely Gothic as opposed to Romanesque.

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">I have</span> already said
enough in reference
to the commanding
position occupied by
Notre Dame among
the monuments of
Paris. The great
cathedral seen at a
distance looks ancient
indeed, but a closer
inspection proves to
us that the hands of
modern men have been
at work on it. Indeed,
one writer goes so far
as to regret that it
has been scraped and patched without, and bedizened and
bedaubed within. In the first edition of Victor Hugo’s
famous novel, <i>Notre Dame</i>, he tells us that if we examine
one by one the traces of destruction imprinted on this
ancient church, the work of time would be found to form
the lesser portion&mdash;the worst destruction has been perpetrated
by men&mdash;especially by men of art. Since Hugo
wrote this much more “restoration” has been carried out
at the metropolitan church of Paris. But though I regret
so-called “restoration” on principle, I cannot help feeling
that the work executed by M. Viollet-le-Duc and M. Lassus
is far less objectionable than it might have been. Fortunately,
unlike so many great Continental churches, Notre Dame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
stands free and clear, and may be examined on all sides
without difficulty. Indeed, it is now perhaps somewhat too
isolated at the west end. Of course it does not possess one
of those venerable closes, with a supplement of ancient ecclesiastical
buildings, which is the glory of the great churches of
our own land.</p>

<p><strong>The Façade.</strong>&mdash;The west fronts of the greater Gothic
churches of France are as a rule the most majestic features
of their exteriors. One might write much to prove that the
west front of Amiens or of Chartres is superior to that of
Notre Dame, but this, after all, is an arguable question. When
we stand in front of the church by the Seine we are struck
by the reticence, by the obvious disdain of the easily obtained
picturesque, which seem to have animated its designers. The
thing is symmetrical with a fine symmetry rare among
buildings of the time. Before we discuss the façade in detail,
let us quote a translation of Victor Hugo’s detailed description,
in the romance already alluded to:</p>

<p>“Assuredly there are few finer pages of architecture than
this façade, in which, successively and at once, the three
receding pointed portals; the decorated and lace-like band
of twenty-eight royal niches; the vast central rose window
flanked by the two lateral ones, like the priest by the deacon
and sub-deacon; the lofty yet slender gallery of trefoiled
arcading, which supports a heavy platform upon its light and
delicate columns; and lastly the two dark and massive towers
with their eaves of slate,<a name="FNanchor-9" id="FNanchor-9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9">[9]</a>&mdash;harmonious parts of an entirely
magnificent whole,&mdash;rising one above another in five gigantic
stories,&mdash;unfolding themselves to the eye combined and unconfused,
with innumerable details of statuary and sculpture
which powerfully emphasise the grandeur of the <i>ensemble</i>: a
vast symphony in stone, if one may say so&mdash;the colossal work
of a man and of a nation ... on each stone of which one
sees, in a hundred varieties, the fancy of the craftsman
disciplined by the artist: a kind of human creation, mighty
and prolific as the Divine Creation itself of which it seems
to have caught the double characteristics&mdash;variety, eternity.”
In the last few phrases Victor Hugo has, perhaps, been guilty
of the licence readily granted to so great a master of rhetoric;
but the west front of Notre Dame was a monument certain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
appeal to a writer to whom none deny the gift of eloquence.
Even a specialist who scrupulously avoids rhapsody is compelled
to use superlatives in his description of this façade: “This
vast and superb design is not only the most elaborate that had
been produced up to its time, but in point of architectural
grandeur it has hardly ever been equalled.” Mr. C. H.
Moore, in the book
alluded to in a former
chapter, rightly insists
that the component
elements of the front
are so treated as to
manifest the Gothic
spirit not merely in the
portals, the arcades,
and the apertures, but
even in so comparatively
small a matter as the
profiles of the mouldings.</p>

</div>

<p>The late P. G. Hamerton has well expressed a feeling
of vague disappointment which many persons who are not
experts in Gothic construction and decoration feel on seeing
the west front: “May I confess frankly,” says Mr. Hamerton,
“that until I had carefully studied it under the guidance of
Viollet-le-Duc, the front of Notre Dame never produced upon
me the same effect as the west fronts of some other French
cathedrals of equal rank? I believe the reason to be that
Notre Dame is not so picturesque as some others, and does
not so much excite the imagination as they do. It is well
ordered, and a perfectly <i>sane</i> piece of work (which Gothic
architecture is not always), but it has not the imaginative
intricacy of Rouen, nor the rich exuberance of Amiens and
Reims, nor the fortress-like grandeur of Bourges, nor the
elegant variety of Chartres.... The truth is that the
virtues of the west front of Notre Dame are classic rather
than romantic. Everything in it seems the result of perfect
knowledge and consummate calculation. There are none of
those mistakes which generally occur in a work of wilder
genius.”</p>

<p>The sculptured decoration of the three great portals exceeds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
if not in actual ornateness, at all events in real beauty, that of
any cathedral in the west of Europe. Much of it has
suffered at the hands of the iconoclast, but, looking to the
vicissitudes through which Notre Dame has passed, it is
wonderful that so much of the original sculpture has been
preserved. The recent restoration has been carried out with
a skill which is simply marvellous,
and the uninformed
observer may easily be betrayed
into the belief that he
is looking at an unaltered
ancient work. Whether this
is a gain or a loss each of
us must decide for himself.
Some able writers have urged
that the success with which
ancient work has been imitated
shows that modern
artists are capable of the
triumphs of the middle ages.
Others dismiss the new work
as an unpardonable forgery.
It is outside the scope of
this book to attempt to describe
in detail the wealth
of statuary and carving which
the thirteenth-century craftsmen
and those of modern
times have lavished on these
portals. For such a description
we must refer the reader
to the voluminous accounts
of Viollet-le-Duc and other
writers. The sculptures of the
north door, called the <i>Portail
de la Saint Vierge</i>, have been described as constituting a complete
poem in stone. Viollet-le-Duc considered the portal as the
masterpiece of French carving of the early thirteenth century.
I adapt the following description of the chief sculptures from
Mr. Lonergan: On the pedestal of the central pier are
bas reliefs representing the Creation of Eve, the Temptation in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the Garden of Eden, and the Ejection from Paradise. Above
is the Virgin crowned, and over her a small gabled construction
referring to the Ark of the Covenant. On the upper part
of the arch in the lower division are three prophets and three
kings. In the second angels hold the winding-sheet in which
Mary’s body lies, near a coffin-shaped tomb. Over this stands
Christ with eight apostles. In the third division we see
Mary glorified. In the <i>voussure</i> are sixty figures of angels,
patriarchs, kings and prophets as witnesses of the Virgin’s
glorification. Under the large statues are medallions referring
to incidents in the lives of those represented. Thirty-seven
bas reliefs ornament the sides and pillars, amongst them being
the signs of the zodiac and symbolic representations of the
months of the year. The ironwork of the doors of this and
of the adjoining portals is of a splendidly elaborate character,
due, according to a quaint tradition, to the skill and energy
of the devil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Central portal</i> has suffered more from mutilation than
those which are on either side of it. In the eighteenth
century the architect Soufflot&mdash;a man who was nothing if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
not “classic”&mdash;removed the dividing pier and cut away the
lower division of the tympanum in order to facilitate the
passage of processions on high ceremonial occasions. All
traces of his vandalism have been removed, and the dividing
pillar bears a modern statue of Christ by Geoffroy Dechaume.
The pedestal is a pentagon, and has seven bas-relief medallions.
At the sides are the apostles, while in the medallions are
represented the virtues and vices. Traces of mutilation are
apparent in much of this work. The tympanum itself is
devoted to the Last Judgment. “First we have figures of the
dead rising at the blast of the trumpet. Men and women of
all conditions and ranks wearily shake off the sleep of death.”
Also there is the Archangel, with representations on the right
of “the elect joyfully glancing heavenwards, while on the
left the grinning demons haul a row of chained souls to hell.
Crowning all is seen the Redeemer, showing the wounds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
His hands. Near Him are two angels, and behind the Virgin
and St. John the Evangelist interceding on their knees for
fallen humanity. As a setting to this magnificent composition
are six rows of sculptured forms, making a <i>voussure</i> or set of
curves, with figures of prophets, doctors, martyrs, devils, toads,
damned souls, and a hideous ape with crooked toes and fingernails.
Some of the ornamentation of the six ranges of arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
curves is gruesome and terrible. It relates either to the
celestial or infernal results of the last judgment.” In its
original state this great doorway must have been a work of
unrivalled dignity. Nowhere else do we find carving more
expressive, nor more perfectly subordinated to the architectural
scheme.</p>

is the most ancient of the three, and contains fragments of “the
sculpture which formerly adorned the old church of St. Stephen
(St. Etienne). These, it is said, were executed at the expense
of Etienne de Garlande, who died in 1142. The dividing
pier or <i>trumeau</i> bears the statue of St. Marcel (<a href="#Page_33">see p. 33</a>). The
tympanum is adorned with the “History of Joachim and Anna,”
the “Marriage of the Virgin,” and the “Budding of Joseph’s
Staff.” Each side is occupied with four statues of saints
of the Old Testament. The four main buttresses which
divide the façade perpendicularly into three parts are pierced
with niches containing statues on a level with the vaulting of
the portals. These statues represent Religion, Faith, St. Denis,
and St. Stephen.</p>

<p>The second story of the façade is occupied by a noble
arcade which shelters twenty-eight colossal statues. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
known as <i>La Galerie des Rois</i>, and stretches across the entire
width of the front. The statues were formerly believed to be
conventional representations of the ancient kings of France,
but they are doubtless intended for the kings of Judah as
ancestors of the Virgin. A similar feature will be found as
part of the façade of Amiens. There, however, the statues
are at a greater height from the ground, and are twenty-two
in number. Above the <i>Galerie des Rois</i> at Paris there is a
graceful open arcade of slender arches and columns. The
five large statues here date only from the year 1854. The
third main division has in the centre a vast wheel window
with open tracery, while in each of the lateral bays we have
pointed arches with twin pointed openings and small circular
panels in the tympanum. The vacant space in the spandrels
of each division is occupied by a trefoil panel. At Amiens
once more we meet with a main division similarly composed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
At Notre Dame, immediately over the division containing
the wheel window, is an open arcaded screen of gigantic
proportions, surmounted by a parapet or pierced cornice
behind which rise the two towers. So dexterously has this
arcade been planned, so graceful are its lines, so delicate
its details, that the impression which it leaves on the mind&mdash;in
spite of the solidity of its construction and the vastness of
its scale&mdash;is almost that of some such unsubstantial material
as lace. To the platform supported by this screen everybody
should ascend, if only to make the acquaintance of the famous
<i>Chimères</i> <a name="italic" id="italic"></a><ins title="Original has italic 'or'">or</ins> “<i>Devils of Notre Dame</i>.” This collection of
specimens of fantastic sculptured zoology is without parallel
in Europe. These weird beasts which scowl from their
point of vantage upon the French metropolis fascinated the
great etcher Méryon, and more recently they have formed
the subject of a series of admirable drawings by Mr. Joseph
Pennell, the value of which has been enhanced by an
essay, partly descriptive, partly philosophical, from the pen
of the late R. A. M. Stevenson. The <i>chimères</i> are not merely
curious examples of the extravagantly grotesque. Their
horror lies, not in their departure from natural forms, but in
the fact that, while the features of various beasts or monsters
are retained, they are impressed with characteristics of ferocity
and cunning which are essentially diabolical or suggestive of
the lowest depths of human depravity. They have nothing
in common with the crude and impossible gargoyles so
frequently found in buildings erected when the pointed style
was in its

<p>Readers of Hugo’s <i>Notre Dame</i> will remember his description
of the Archdeacon as he clung to the lead gutter of the tower:
“Meanwhile he felt himself going bit by bit; his fingers
slipped upon the gutter; he felt more and more the increasing
weakness of his arms and the weight of his body; the piece
of lead which supported him inclined more and more downwards.
He saw beneath him, frightful to contemplate, the
pointed roof of St. Jean-le-Rond, small as a card bent double.
He looked, one after another, at the imperturbable sculptures
of the tower&mdash;like him suspended over the precipice&mdash;but
without terror for themselves or pity for him. All around
him was stone,&mdash;before his eyes the gaping monsters; in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>

<p>The <strong>Towers</strong>, though not of precisely the same size, appear
to be so. The summit of the north tower is reached by
an ascent of two hundred and ninety-seven steps. Each
of the towers is pierced with coupled pointed openings and
profusely enriched with mouldings and gargoyles. Both of
them terminate with open parapets, the staircases ending in
small turrets. The panorama of Paris from the top is
magnificent, while the view of Notre Dame itself reveals to
the full its structural beauty. Few sights are more impressive
than that of the great roof ridge of the church, broken by
the graceful modern <i>flèche</i>, and ending in the circular <i>chevet</i>.
From this high place, likewise, one is able fully to appreciate
the grand arrangement of flying buttresses, the forest of
pinnacles, the host of gargoyles, statues, and other sculptured
ornaments which adorn the structure. Of the famous peal
of thirteen ancient <i>bells</i> which formerly occupied the belfries
of the two towers, only one&mdash;<i>le bourdon de Notre Dame</i>&mdash;still
remains. It has announced to Paris most of the great victories
of the French army, and it still gives the signal to other bells
to usher in the great festivals of the Church. Of the other
bells existing here, the most interesting is one of Russian
workmanship, which was brought from Sebastopol.</p>

<p>The <strong>Flèche</strong>, over the crossing, was built in 1859&ndash;60, the
ancient one being destroyed in 1787 and replaced by a bulb-like
structure which was
<a name="irreverently" id="irreverently"></a><ins title="Original has 'irrevently'">irreverently</ins>
compared to a pepper box.
To this circumstance Victor Hugo alludes scornfully: “Un
architecte de bon goût l’a amputé, et a cru qu’il suffisait
de masquer la plaie avec ce large emplâtre de plomb, qui
ressemble au couvercle d’une marmite.” In removing this
atrocity Viollet-le-Duc was assuredly performing a necessary
service. His elaborate though slender steeple is of oak
covered with lead, and weighs 750,000 kilos. It is ornamented
with numberless crockets and pierced with well-contrived
openings. The base is led up to by tiers of statues placed
on brackets in the angles formed by the junction of the roofs
of the nave, transepts and choir. The ball below the cross
encloses reputed fragments of the cross and the crown
of thorns. There can be little doubt that Viollet-le-Duc,
speaking generally, has constructed a flèche which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
have commended itself to
mediæval designers. It is interesting
to note the slender
character of the structures
which in France rise above
the crossings, as compared
with the huge towers which
occupy a like position in the
English cathedrals of Lincoln,
Canterbury and York,
or with the comparatively
substantial spires to be
found at Salisbury, Norwich
and Lichfield.</p>

<p><strong>The Buttress System.</strong>&mdash;The
buttress system of
Notre Dame has been the
subject of careful study and
explanation by Mr. Moore.
“In the external system,”
he remarks, “the flying buttresses
were, as at first
constructed, magnificently
developed, and were double
in a twofold sense. That
is, the piers which divide
the double aisles were formerly
carried up through
the roof so as to form buttresses
to the vaulted triforium
gallery, and, rising
above the roof of this gallery,
they received the heads of
the double flying buttresses
over the outer aisle, and
gave foothold to another
pair of arches over the triforium
gallery. The lower
arch of the outer pair was
above the aisle roof, while the lower arch of the inner pair
was beneath the roof of the triforium. The principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
equilibrium maintained by opposing thrusts was here completely
developed; the inert principle no longer governs the
construction, though a survival of the former method of
building is found in the walls of the aisles and clerestory,
which are no longer necessary to the strength of the edifice.”
The flying buttresses, as we now see them, are (according to
Viollet-le-Duc) alterations dating from the early part of the
thirteenth century. They consist of huge arches clearing both
aisles with a single span. The flying buttresses of the upper
tier are wonderfully light and elegant, looking always to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
large span which they have to clear. They join the space
between the windows of the clerestory to lofty upright
buttresses terminating in fine crocketed pinnacles and ornamented
with an amazing wealth of sculpture. The flying
buttresses of the lower tier are thicker, and most frequently
spring from elaborate <i>clochetons</i>, one of which is illustrated here.</p>

<div class="clear-both">WINDOWS ON THE SOUTH SIDE.]</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><strong>The Windows</strong> of Notre Dame are on the vast scale
which is usual in the greater Gothic churches of the Ile-de-France,
and present a very remarkable contrast to the small
and simple windows which were deemed sufficient by the
builders of our own early cathedrals in the pointed style.
At Notre Dame the area of solid wall is slight in relation to
the area filled in with glass. It is not so much a case of
windows in walls, as of walls connecting windows. The
external buttress system and the internal vaulting system at
Notre Dame comprise the essentials of the structure, so that
the walls are of the nature of enclosures rather than necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
structural parts. We have travelled far from the Romanesque
principle, in which the walls were primarily weight-bearers.
The windows of the aisles and of the ambulatory are of great
size and display many differences of detail, but they nevertheless
maintain a general similarity, the designers, while
appreciating the value of uniformity, being too richly endowed
with the prevailing fertility of invention in matters of decorative
detail exactly to repeat even the most successful arrangement.
Each is divided into two main pointed lights, above which a
large circle, quatrefoil or similar device, occupies the head of
the window, the arches also being cusped or foiled in varying
patterns. The main lights are again subdivided into two,
with trefoils or quatrefoils in the heads.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<a name="img-47" id="img-47"></a>
<img src="images/i-047.jpg" width="500" height="329" alt="" />

<div class="float-right">[<i>Ed. Hautecœur, Paris.</i></div>
<div class="clear-both">TRIFORIUM WINDOWS.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Above these noble windows are gabled heads whose sides
are enriched with crockets or cusps, their centres being
occupied with circular decorative panels, and their angles
having small richly carved bosses. Sometimes the canopies
consist of beautiful open-work. Everywhere grotesque gargoyles
project between them, and the mouldings terminate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
corbels in the shape of small, highly wrought human heads.
This series of windows emphasises the prodigality with which
sculpture in human forms or in the forms of naturalistic or
fantastic animals is to be found in nearly all parts of Notre
Dame. It is this prodigality, wisely distributed, which places
this cathedral in such acute contrast&mdash;speaking from the
standpoint of the uninitiated observer&mdash;to our own early pointed
structures. The upper aisle-wall between the lower tier of
flying buttresses is in some parts of the building occupied by
wheel windows of varied pattern, most elaborately ornamented.
But at the east end the triforium lights show another device:
two small arches have in the angle between them quatrefoiled
openings. It is notable that this dignified and beautiful
device is foreshadowed by some of the windows in the
Byzantine church in Athens, and even in the sixth-century
church of Qualb Louzeh, in Central Syria.</p>

<p>The clerestory lights occupy the full width of the space
between the piers of the upper flying buttresses. Finally, at
the base of the roof runs an open-work parapet. As we have
already observed, many of the windows were hastily rebuilt
after the fire of which we have previously spoken.</p>

<div class="clear-both">NORTH TRANSEPT FRONT.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><strong>North and South Transept Fronts.</strong>&mdash;These, as we
have seen, are comparatively late work, but though subordinate
to the great façade, they are of intricate design and great
ornateness. They fail of effect, however, when they are
compared with the monumental and inevitable grandeur of
the west front. The south façade, of the date 1257, is
undoubtedly the work of Jean de Chelles. An inscription
tells us very exactly that it was begun on the second day
of the Ides of February, in honour of the mother of Christ.
There are writers who would have us believe that to the
work of de Chelles we should apply, if not the word
“debased,” at least the word “flamboyant.” For this there
seems to be no good reason, unless, indeed, we are prepared
to allow that systems of architectural classification are more
important than the buildings which are their subject-matter.
It will be at once recognised that the lateral fronts of
Notre Dame&mdash;while they lack the elementary grandeur so
conspicuous in the works of the pioneers of Gothic in the
Ile-de-France&mdash;have nothing in common with the later Perpendicular
buildings of England, wherein decoration runs riot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and construction sometimes degenerates into trickery. The
great feature of each of these minor fronts is a vast rose
window. It is difficult to repress the feeling that these
fronts have been deliberately constructed with a view to lend
emphasis to these lovely circular insertions, rich as they are
in appropriate tracery. Whether or not we are to limit the
work of Jean de Chelles to the southern front (or the lower
portion of it), or whether we are to attribute to him the
opposite front and the arrangement of chapels adjacent to
and east of the transepts, is a nice question. The documentary
evidence, to which access is difficult, would, indeed, appear
narrowly to limit the work of Jean de Chelles to that fragment
with which he has been immemorially associated. But it
were unwise to rely too closely on ancient documents in
which definite statements of fact are not to be found. It
is possible that, even if Jean de Chelles did not personally
superintend the erection of the southern front, he designed
the opposite front and the chapels in question. He may,
indeed, have left pupils fully acquainted with his methods
and nearly tied to him by bonds of sentiment, who in their
own productions perpetuated, not merely the main features of
the style of their master, but used exactly the same material
as he employed. Once more, the sculptor is prominent; once
more, the structural parts are adorned with beautiful statuary.
The great point is that (using the word as widely as it may
fairly be used) uniformity is achieved. Of Notre Dame we
may say&mdash;what we cannot say of buildings possibly more
interesting to the architect and the antiquary&mdash;that from east
to west, from north to south, it strikes the observer as the
splendid outcome of a single imagination, or of a number
of imaginations dominated by the same impulse, rather than
the haphazard result of peculiar and fortuitous circumstances.

OF THE NORTH TRANSEPT DOORWAY.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sculpture of the portal of the North Transept is devoted
to the history of the Virgin&mdash;of whom the dividing pier between
the doors bears a beautiful statue. The carving in the lowest
division of the tympanum deals with the Birth of Christ, the
Visit of the Magi, the Presentation in the Temple, and the
Flight into Egypt. The carving of the other divisions refers
to the history of Theophilus, a mythical monk who signed
a contract with the Devil, like Faust, but was saved by
the interference of the Virgin. On each side of the portal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
are three empty niches. These, as well as the portal, possess
canopies. An arcade of lights is the chief feature, between
the entrance and the great rose window previously alluded
to. The portal of the South Transept has figures of Christ,
St. Martin, St. Stephen, St. John the Baptist, Moses, St. Denis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
St. Thomas, St. Peter, St. Bartholomew, David, and Aaron.
The tympanum has a representation of the Martyrdom of
St. Stephen. This portal is seldom used. Again we have
the arcade of lights leading to the great rose. The gable
end is in its turn pierced by another smaller circular
window of remarkable beauty. It will be seen that while
there are great differences between the fronts of the two
transepts, structurally they resemble one another.</p>

<p>Returning to the north side of the church, beneath one of
the windows belonging to a choir chapel is the well-known
<i>Porte Rouge</i>, a delicate masterpiece which we may probably
attribute to the early part of the fourteenth century. In its
tympanum is represented the Coronation of the Virgin, while
in its vaulting we have scenes in the life of St. Marcel. The
door gained its name from the fact that it was originally painted
red. It seems always to have held a high place in the
affections of the Parisians. Victor Hugo appears specially
to have delighted in it, for he writes: “La petite Porte-Rouge
atteint presque les limites des délicatesses gothiques du
quinzième siècle.” Near the
<i><a name="Porte" id="Porte"></a><ins title="Original has 'Port Rouge'">Porte Rouge</ins></i>,
under the windows
of the Choir chapels, are seven bas-reliefs representing scenes
from the Virgin’s life. They date from the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>He must be insensible indeed to the grandeur of Gothic
building who fails to be impressed when he stands at the
east end of Notre Dame. There, in the great main circular
sweep, we can appreciate the tiers of buttresses, the spear-like
forest of pinnacles, each one constructively necessary,
each duly subordinated to an ordered scheme, each wisely
and appropriately decorated. Standing here, we are indeed
under the spell of the august <i>ecclesia parisiaca</i>, the ancient
silent witness of changes so immense and so fruitful of result,
of victories in the arts alike of peace and war which have
been of such profound consequence not merely to Paris,
and to France, but to mankind in general.</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span>THE INTERIOR.&mdash;THE NAVE.</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">It</span> is difficult accurately to state why a sense of disappointment
is so often felt on entering the Cathedral of Paris. The
unsatisfactory impression given by Notre Dame is one experienced
by visitors of all kinds. The architectural critic,
who looks upon a Gothic church as the result of certain
clearly defined principles of construction and decoration, must
inevitably find in it much to admire. But while it satisfies
the specialist, and possibly impresses those who have little
pretence to technical information, it lacks the qualities of
mystery and of surprise which distinguish some buildings less
ancient and less stately. Thus we find one writer complaining
that it is heavy, another that it is cold, and a third that it
is relatively unpicturesque. Most of those who have recorded
their dissatisfaction with the interior of Notre Dame have
sought to explain the causes thereof. The splendid promise
of the exterior, it is suggested, discounts the remarkable
beauties of the inside. Some feel that the regularity, the
coherence which distinguish the church, produce an <i>ensemble</i>
at once ponderous and monotonous. Others complain of
the lack of colour; while on the other hand not a few
protest against the intrusion of recent polychromatic decorations.
It is possible that the secret lies in certain structural
idiosyncrasies. The church is extremely broad in comparison
with its length. The bays are so few as to give to the
interior an air of undue severity. Fergusson, in his history
of architecture, condemns the vaulting ribs as ineffective. The
marble pavement is regarded on all hands as a misfortune:
nothing could be more tedious or inappropriate. It is,
however, to be observed that as one becomes familiar with
the interior its shortcomings are forgotten and the dignity
of its proportions and details are apprehended more fairly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
<strong>Dimensions.</strong>&mdash;The length of Notre Dame is 390 ft.; the
width at the transepts, 144 ft.; the length of the nave,
225 ft.; and the width of the nave (without the aisles), 39 ft.
The height of the vaulting is 102 ft. De Breul, in his
<i>Théâtre des Antiquités de Paris</i>, mentions a copper tablet
which formerly hung against one of the pillars of Notre Dame
and gave the dimensions of the cathedral in the following
verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>The curiosity of these lines excuses the inaccurate statements,
comparatively trifling, conveyed in them. Notre Dame,
unlike most mediæval churches on the Continent, is almost
painfully clean. The gaudy shrines which render some of
the most splendid of Italian churches almost grotesque are
absent from Notre Dame. The broom and the duster have
been too freely used: all that is not appropriate has been
too sedulously banished.</p>

<p>In the old floor, amongst a multitude of other interesting
memorials of the dead, the tombstones of the following were
to be found: Philippe (son of Louis VI. and Archdeacon of
Paris), <i>d.</i> 1161; Prince Geoffrey of England, <i>d.</i> 1186; Queen
Isabelle of Hainault, <i>d.</i> 1189; the dauphin, Louis (son of
Charles VI.), <i>d.</i> 1415; Louise (mother of François I.), <i>d.</i>
1531; and Louis XIII. (his viscera only), 1643. Amongst
the more famous ecclesiastics were the following: Eudes de
Sully (1208); Etienne II. (1279); Cardinal Aymeric de
Magnac (1348); Bishop Pierre d’Orgemont (1409); and
Dumoulin, Patriarch of Antioch (1447). In addition there were
three Archbishops of Paris who died during the seventeenth
century, and Renaud, Archbishop of Sens (<i>d.</i> 1616). The
substitution of squares of marble for the tombstones of these
historic personages admits of absolutely no defence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Let us now consider the <strong>Roof</strong>. Mr. Charles Herbert
Moore thus describes it in his <i>Development and Character of
Gothic Architecture</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Here is a vast nave (completed except the extreme west
end by about the year 1196), so admirably roofed with stone
that the work has lasted intact for seven hundred years, and
will probably, if not wantonly injured, last for centuries to
come. These vaults are sexpartite.... The diagonal ribs
are round-arched, while the transverse and longitudinal ribs
are pointed. The intermediate transverse ribs are, however,
pointed but slightly; and to bring their crowns up to the
level of the intersections of the diagonals they are considerably
stilted. The crowns of the main transverse ribs are a little
lower than those of the diagonals, and those of the longitudinals
are lower still. The vaults have, therefore, a distinctly domical
form. These various adjustments, by greater or less pointing,
stilting, and even by the retention of the round arch where it
will serve best, exhibit the flexibility of the Gothic system in
an interesting and instructive manner.” Mr. Moore, after some
further details, continues:&mdash;“In the vaults of Paris, as in all
Gothic vaults, the shells consist of successive courses of masonry
which are slightly arched from rib to rib over each triangular
cell. The beds of these successive courses are not parallel,
but are variously inclined according as the mason found
necessary or convenient in developing the concave and winding
surfaces engendered by the forms and positions of the
ribs to which they had to be accommodated. These courses
of masonry have here in Paris, as they have in most Gothic
vaults, a considerable inclination near the springing from the
longitudinal rib upward toward the diagonal, and they become
gradually more level as they approach the crown of the vault,
where they are more nearly parallel. But perfectly parallel
they can hardly ever be, since each course forms a portion
of a surface that is concaved in all directions.” Mr. Moore
adds that in the earliest and finest Gothic vaultings this
masonry is composed of small stones perfectly faced and
closely jointed; and the vaulting of Paris, especially that of
the choir, is a model of careful and finished workmanship.</p>

<p>The vaulting of the choir differs from that of the nave,
but the difference is one rather of detail than of principle.
We have already said much about the external buttress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
system by which this splendid roof is sustained. Internally
this vaulting rises from slender shafts springing from the
capitals of the great cylindrical columns constituting the main
arcade of the ground story. The piers at Paris are ill
adjusted to the vaults, a feature which has resulted in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
immense amount of learned discussion. They were obviously
intended for quadripartite vaulting. It seems probable that
suddenly, for a reason which we are not now in a position
to appreciate, the quadripartite form was abandoned in favour
of the sexpartite form actually adopted. Students of this
subject are advised to refer to pp. 114&ndash;15 of the second edition
of Mr. Moore’s book, where the differences between the
vaulting imposts of the nave and choir are discussed and
delineated. They may profitably compare this with M.
Viollet-le-Duc’s <i>Construction</i> (p. 164). M. Viollet-le-Duc, it
may be added, suggests that
the necessities of the sexpartite
system were provided
for by the monolithic shafts
grouped round every other
pier in the arcade dividing
the aisles.</p>

<div class="caption">CAPITAL IN THE NAVE.<br />
<i>From Viollet-le-Duc.</i></div>
</div>

<p>The somewhat heavy
character of the great cylindrical
piers which divide the
nave from the aisles is
largely redeemed by the
beautiful carving with which
the capitals are ornamented.
The plants which the sculptors
have conventionalised
are those commonly found in
the fields adjacent to Paris.
These ornate capitals are genuinely Gothic in feeling, and have
nothing in common with those which crown the piers of our
Anglo-Norman (Romanesque) cathedrals. Again, the plinths
of the columns are utterly unlike the simple and massive
bases on which the round columns of our older churches
most often rest. We have already alluded to the ill-adaptation
of these piers and their capitals to the sexpartite form of
vaulting employed. In the case of the most westerly piers
of the main arcade an attempt seems to have been made&mdash;with
no great success, as it appears to me&mdash;to minimise the
illogical effect of the vaulting imposts. The result has been
the emphasis of that very want of congruity which it was
sought to remedy. It would be difficult to find a less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
satisfactory arrangement than that which obtains in the pier
and capital delineated in our illustration, where four smaller
cylinders are attached to the main one. Here, not merely
is the pier itself rendered unwieldy by its satellites, but the
capital loses all symmetry owing to the interposition of the
small capitals which crown those satellites. It will be noticed
that the arches of the main arcade are by no means uniform.
Thus we have a wide arch adjacent to an extremely narrow
one, while the builders of the period did not hesitate to make
use of a round arch where they found that form more
convenient. It is in some measure these peculiarities which
have induced not a few authors to describe Notre Dame as
a transitional church.</p>

<p>In no part of Notre Dame do we more perfectly appreciate
the grandeur of the scale of the church than when we stand
in the vast double aisles on either side of the nave. With
every step we take the view changes. We hesitate to leave
the spot upon which we stand lest we should lose its charm,
and yet we feel that probably a vista even more beautiful
awaits us a few paces beyond. The lines of vast piers seem
as if they were consciously engaged in surprising us: now
they come together and close the view suddenly, unexpectedly;
then they open, revealing a richly furnished altar in, as it were,
a colossal frame of masonry. Everywhere the lines of the
building strike us as vast, massive, almost elemental, but
everywhere there is an ordered, if a somewhat ponderous
symmetry. It is strange that there ever was an age in which
the innate dignity and majesty of these lines were not felt. Yet
so barbarous did the architecture of Notre Dame appear to
eighteenth-century eyes, that a desperate attempt was made
to hide it. Vast pictures in gilt frames were placed from
capital to capital of the main arcade on both sides. In this
way the arches were completely hidden, and a square appearance
(supposed to suggest the classical) was given to the
lowest story. The openings of the triforium were spared,
as anything placed in front of them would block the view
of the crowds who used to fill the <i>tribunes</i> on state occasions.
The nave, however, thus turned into a kind of picture gallery,
was considered very satisfactory (see illustration, p. 11).
Needless to say, no trace of the pictures now remains, and
the great arches are free and open once more. The piers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
dividing the aisles are not all of the same construction.
Round every other pier are grouped monolithic shafts, possessing
delicately foliated capitals with moulded abaci. Two
shafts, with a single abacus and plinth, alternate with a single
shaft. In all there are twelve shafts round the pier. These
piers, with their cluster of satellites, contrast finely with the
simple cylinders with bold foliated capitals with which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
alternate, and lend variety and interest to the arcades (see
illustration, p. 23).</p>

<p>The vaulting of the aisles is quadripartite, the ribs being
strongly marked and possessing carved bosses at the point of
intersection. Beyond the outer aisles on each side is a series
of chapels, which will be described presently. The accompanying
illustrations give a good idea of the piers, capitals and
vaulting of this part of the church.</p>

<p><strong>The Triforium</strong>, to which there are four staircases, is of
immense size, owing to the fact that it passes over the double
aisles on both sides of the nave. Its designers no doubt
contemplated its use as a gallery from which the grand
ceremonies which took place in the church could be witnessed
by large numbers of people. It is ceiled with stone&mdash;a feature
common to most of the greater cathedrals of France&mdash;so that
no wooden beams can be seen anywhere in the building. This
obviously increases the massiveness of the whole, though
a certain tendency to heaviness is perhaps emphasised. The
masonry is everywhere very fine, and in the small details a
high degree of wise as opposed to futile finish is maintained
throughout. The galleries are excellently lighted. Above the
nave-aisles low pointed arches enclose a foliated circle, the
corners at the base being filled with small trefoils. In the choir
the lights consist of rose or wheel windows, in the tracery of
which there is great variety of pattern. The openings towards
the church take their place admirably in the elevation, being in
character with the main arcade beneath and the clerestory
above. They are almost austerely simple, and possess none
of the ornateness which characterises the triforiums of
Westminster, Lincoln, and other English buildings of slightly
later date. A large plain pointed arch encloses two and in
some cases three pointed arches, which are separated from one
another by delicate columns bearing foliated capitals with
square abaci. They have small square bases. These columns
are a hundred and four in number. A low openwork railing
of iron fills in the front of the gallery. The triforium goes
round the whole building: that portion which is at the end
of the transepts, however, consists of a narrow passage which
is not open to the church. The banners which were captured
by French armies were exhibited from the triforium so long
as war continued. On the conclusion of peace, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
taken down&mdash;a proceeding which might be followed in other
countries with advantage. The part of the triforium in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
choir differs only in detail from that in the nave. Over the
triforium come the vast windows, altered in the thirteenth
century, which comprise the <strong>Clerestory</strong>, of which more
is said on page 72. The stained glass will be fully discussed
hereafter.</p>

</div>

<p>The upper portion of the west end is filled by the great
rose window, which, as we have noticed, is so beautiful a
feature of the façade. The tops of the pipes of the great
organ hide the lower part of it from our view inside. The
lovely painted glass, which is ancient, has representations of
the Virgin and Child surrounded by prophets. Amongst other
features are the signs of the Zodiac, the labours of the months,
and the Virtues in triumph with lances in their hands. The
gallery on which the organ is now placed was possibly used
for the performance of miracle plays. As it is at a relatively
great height from the pavement, this is at least doubtful. The
<strong>Organ</strong> is a fine instrument of wonderful power. It was
practically rebuilt by Thierry Lesclope in 1730, and enlarged
by Cliquot in 1785. In recent years it has been immensely
improved by M. Cavaillé-Coll, who gave it 5266 pipes and
80 stops. It plays a great part in the splendid musical
services for which the Cathedral is famous.</p>

<p>The Nave is almost devoid of monuments; nothing breaks
up the vast lines of the architecture. The most important
tomb is that of Jean Etienne Yver, Canon of Paris and
Rouen, who died in February 1467. It has escaped serious
mutilation, and is a realistic performance in the style prevailing
in France at the end of the fifteenth century. On the base is
a gruesome representation of the body of the Canon being
given over to the worms. Above this, two saints are helping
him to rise from the coffin, and directing his attention towards
Heaven. The whole thing is repulsive, but it is interesting
as a curiosity. Many historic memorials perished during the
Revolution, but some were removed to Versailles and still
exist there. They include the tombs of Jean Jouvenel des
Ursins (<i>d.</i> 1431) and his wife Michelle de Vitry; the Maréchal
Albert de Gondi, Duc de Retz (<i>d.</i> 1602); and his brother
Pierre de Gondi, Bishop of Paris (<i>d.</i> 1616). Two monuments
have disappeared from the nave which were highly esteemed
in their day. Writing of Notre Dame in his <i>Crudities</i> in
1611, Thomas Coryat says: “I could see no notable matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
in the
<a name="cathedral" id="cathedral"></a><ins title="Original has 'cathedrall'">cathedral</ins>
church, saving the statue of Saint Christopher
on the right hand at the coming in of the great gate, which is
indeed very exquisitely done, all the rest being but ordinary.”
The statue so delighted the old traveller that he had eyes for
nothing else, for the architecture of Notre Dame is anything
but ordinary. The Chapter of the Cathedral did not share his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
view, for they deliberately destroyed it in 1786. It was
presented to the church in 1413 by Antoine des Essarts,
whose tomb with his effigy in armour stood near it. Its
destruction is remarkable, for colossal things were very much
to the taste of those who lived at the end of the seventeenth
century. The Revolution is responsible for the destruction of
a famous equestrian statue which stood in the nave until
1792. It is generally considered to have been that of
Philippe le Bel, clothed in the armour in which he won his
victory over the Flemings at Mons-en-Pucelle in 1304. The
identity of the statue has, however, been the subject of
controversy. Viollet-le-Duc tells us that it represented, not
Philippe le Bel, but Philippe VI. (of Valois), who defeated the
Flemings at Cassel in 1328. On his return to Paris he rode
into the cathedral on horseback in state, and vowed his
harness to the Virgin. The Chapter disagree with Viollet-le-Duc,
who is, however, supported in his contention by the
Benedictine Père Montfaucon, by the writers who continued
the chronicle of William of Nangis, and some others. The
monument stood close to the last pillar on the right side of
the nave. The <strong>Pulpit</strong> is a modern work, after the design
of Viollet-le-Duc. It is of oak, and its decorations include
statues of six of the apostles and of angelic figures. Suspended
from the vaulting are eight imposing candelabra in bronze-gilt.</p>

<p><strong>The Chapels of the Nave</strong> contain singularly few features
of historic interest, nor amongst the furniture of their altars are
there many recent works of art of outstanding merit. They
introduce us, however, to the vast scheme of mural painting
which has been carried out from the designs and partly under
the direction of Viollet-le-Duc. There can be no doubt
that some scheme of polychromatic decoration was legitimate:
almost every ancient church in France has indisputable evidence
of its employment in the middle ages. The problem which
faced Viollet-le-Duc was one of extreme difficulty. The area
to be covered was enormous: the variations of light were
excessive. Some parts were luminous, even radiant; others
were hidden in almost continuous gloom. The schemes of
colour had to be adapted to these varying conditions. The
use of mosaic was considered and discarded. The expense
would have been gigantic, and the material was considered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
perhaps rightly, to be inappropriate to the style of architecture.
Wall pictures, as such, were regarded as destructive to the
<i>ensemble</i>, fatiguing to the eyes and mind, and productive of
a certain patchy effect. A series of symbolical patterns of
a rigidly conventional type, in which human figures are very
sparingly used, was devised. It may be admitted at once
that the learning and ingenuity displayed in the design of
the scheme were such as might be expected from the most
erudite and accomplished French architectural scholar of our
time. The minute consideration which Viollet-le-Duc devoted
to the subject may be judged from the following passage:
“D’abord, la cathédrale de Paris, comme on sait, est orientée
de telle façon que tout un côté du monument se présente vers
le midi et l’autre vers le nord. Un de ces côtés reçoit donc
une lumière plus vive et plus colorée que l’autre. Il a paru
qu’il était nécessaire de profiter de cette disposition pour
établir l’harmonie générale. Au lieu de combattre l’effet
de cette orientation, on a cru devoir l’appuyer. Ainsi, en
premier lieu, toutes les fenêtres des chapelles tournées vers
le sud sont garnies de grisailles à tons nacrés et froids. De
là il resulte qu’en entrant dans le monument on voit un côté
de lumière, un côté d’ombre, un côté chaud et brillant et
un côté froid. Il en
<a name="resulte" id="resulte"></a><ins title="Original has 'résultei nstinctivement'">résulte instinctivement</ins>
pour l’œil un effet
général tranquille. Rien n’est plus fatigant pour les yeux
qu’un intérieur éclairé par les jours contraires de qualités
semblables comme intensité de lumière, valeur de tons et
coloration. La peinture des chapelles devait concorder
naturellement avec le système de répartition de la lumière.
Suivant une règle générale, la tonalité des peintures du côté
nord est plus froide que celle du côté du midi. Cependant,
comme il faut conserver l’unité, de distance en distance, du
côté sud, des tons gris, des tons verts, froids, rappellent
l’harmonie générale du côté nord, et, du côté septentrional,
des tons chauds rappellent l’harmonie générale du côté
méridional.”<a name="FNanchor-11" id="FNanchor-11"></a><a href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a></p>

A. Morel. See the preface by Viollet-le-Duc for further details of his
principles of decoration.</p>
</div>

<p>In spite of all these elaborate precautions, in spite of so
much patience and learning, the result as a whole seems to
me unsatisfactory. One wearies of the ingenious geometrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
curves, the crosses, the squares, the lozenges, the coloured
stars, the excessively and laboriously conventionalised foliage,
and the rest. The whole strikes one as dead and mechanical,
as mere covering of stone for the sake of doing so. And the
colour, though by no means aggressive, is unsatisfying. The
experiment was heroic, and the result might certainly have
been very much worse, but the stone-work would have been
better untouched.</p>

<p>The Chapels on the north side of the nave (from west
to east) are: 1. The <i>Chapelle des Fonts Baptismaux</i>. The
bronze carving of the font is by Brachelet. 2. The <i>Chapelle
Saint-Charles</i>. There are a statue in painted stone by
M. de Chaume and a good piscina. The wall decorations
are cold and sombre. 3. The <i>Chapelle de la Sainte-Enfance</i>.
It contains a group representing Christ caressing a French
and a Chinese child, by M. de Chaume. 4. The <i>Chapelle
Saint-Vincent-de-Paul</i>. The decorations of this chapel are
somewhat elaborate, and gilding is freely used. 5. The
<i>Chapelle de Saint-François-Xavier</i>. There is a group representing
the Saint baptising a Chinese. 6. <i>Chapelle de Saint-Landry</i>,
with statue by De Chaume. 7. <i>Chapelle de Sainte-Clotilde</i>,
with statue by the same artist.</p>

<p>The following are on the south side (west to east):</p>

<p>1. <i>Chapelle des Ames du Purgatoire.</i> Christ rescuing a soul
from Purgatory. A statue by De Chaume in coloured stone.
The colour scheme of the chapel is warm and brilliant.
2. <i>Chapelle de Sainte-Geneviève.</i> The decorations, which are
somewhat profuse, were given by the “dames de l’Institut
de l’œuvre de Sainte Geneviève.” 3. <i>Chapelle Saint-Joseph</i>,
with statue of Joseph with the Child Jesus in his arms.
4. <i>Chapelle Saint-Pierre.</i> Statue in wood of the saint by
M. Corbon. The carved woodwork of the sixteenth century
still remains, and includes panels with representations of
the Twelve Apostles, St. Germain, and Sainte Geneviève.
5. <i>Chapelle Saint-Anne.</i> 6. <i>Chapelle du Sacré-Cœur.</i> Statue
in coloured stone by M. de Chaume. 7. <i>Chapelle de
l’Annonciation.</i> With a statue of the Virgin in wood by
M. Corbon. Paintings by Perrodin, one of the best pupils

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Before we turn from the nave to the choir and transepts,
let us say a few words as to the <i>stained glass</i>, which was once
the glory of the church. There is probably no Gothic interior
in France which has suffered more terribly from the destruction
of its ancient windows than Notre Dame. The coldness
and severity which the mural decorations of Viollet-le-Duc
vainly strive to mitigate were perhaps not felt at all when the
light from every window seemed to be transmitted in glowing
and gleaming shafts of every conceivable colour and tone.
Fortunately, the old glass still remains in the great rose
windows. That over the west door has been described;
the others will be noticed in the account of the transepts.
The rest of the glass was deliberately destroyed, not by an
infuriated mob, but by those in authority, in 1741.</p>

<p>The work of destruction was performed by Jean Leviel and
his brother, who cheerfully substituted for the priceless
material they removed great sheets of dull, monotonous
<i>grisaille</i>, with borders ornamented with the <i>fleur-de-lis</i>. The
introduction of <i>grisaille</i> has been quaintly described by
Michelet as <i>le protestantisme entrant dans la peinture</i>. Its use
at Notre Dame is nothing short of a disaster. Efforts have
been made in some parts of the building to replace it with
glass of a less sombre character, but these efforts so far have
done little to lessen our regret for the calamity of 1741.

<span>THE TRANSEPTS AND THE CHOIR.</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> austere character of the nave emphasises the splendid
decorations of the eastern parts. No massive screen prevents
our seeing the church from the great entrance to the apse.
The fact that the choir is open possibly lessens our sense of
mystery and of awe, but we are more than compensated by
the splendid view of the building from end to end.</p>

<p>The irritating custom of railing off the eastern limb of the
church and demanding a fee for admission happily does not
obtain at Notre Dame. It is all but universal in England, and
renders an intelligent appreciation of the architectural history
of our great churches a matter of some difficulty. At Paris
one may wander where one will, so long as one does not
interrupt the offices. That pompous and irresponsible
chatterer the cathedral verger does not impose himself upon
us, and disturb our study and diminish our pleasure, as he
does in churches on this side the Channel. Only the Sacristy
need be visited in the company of an official.</p>

<p>The transepts of French cathedrals are rarely such important
features as they are in those of this country. The vast church
of Bourges has no transepts at all. At Noyon, as at Paris,
the transepts have no aisles. Of the crossing and transepts
at Paris Viollet-le-Duc and Guilhermy write as follows:</p>

<p>“At the four angles of the crossing, massive piers, some
covered with combined pilasters, others with clustered columns,
rise without a break from the ground to the vaulting. The
two transepts at the outset were only of two bays similar to
those of the nave. They were lengthened by a shallower bay
when the façades were rebuilt. The later bays are easily
distinguished from the four older ones. Thin round vaulting-ribs
cross at a crown deeper and more pronounced than those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
of the older parts. The north and south doors are set in a
rich arcading, of which the divisions and the tympanums
can be compared to nothing more fitly than a large window
with mullions. In the south transept, statues more or less
mutilated, representing Christ and the saints, remain at the
points of the gables. In describing the exterior of the façades
we pointed out the open gallery which extends the whole
breadth of each transept, and the great rose window a little
above it. The exterior arcading of the gallery is repeated by
a similar arcading inside. There is a passage between the
two rows of little columns, and there is another above this.
The effect of the rose windows in the interior, with glowing
stained glass in all their compartments, recalls the marvellous
descriptions that Dante has given us of the circles of Paradise.
The incomparable splendour alternately astonishes and enchants
us. To decorate the side walls of his bays, Jean de
Chelles continued the arcading and the mullioned windows.”</p>

<p>The vaulting and the rose of the south transept were
repaired between the years 1725 and 1728 by Boffrand, the
king’s architect, at the expense of Cardinal de Noailles. The
pair of arches leading to the choir aisles with their elaborate
crocketed canopies are somewhat feebly contrived in both
transepts. The clustered shafts are clumsily arranged. The
details on the north side differ from those on the south. On
the east and west sides of both transepts there are two narrow
bays of the triforium. The clerestory consists of short pointed
windows with wheel windows beneath them. This is due to
Viollet-le-Duc, and is intended to show us the arrangement
which obtained throughout the church previous to the
alterations which resulted from the fire in the thirteenth

Belloc thus refers to the fire of 1218: “In 1218 a happy accident gave
us the incomparable unity which the Cathedral alone possesses among
mediæval monuments; for in that year, on the eve of the Assumption,
four inspired thieves climbed into the roof-tree and warily let down ropes
with slip-knots to lasso the silver candlesticks on the altar. These they
snared, but as they pulled them up the lights set fire to the hangings that
were stretched for the feasts, and the fire spread to the whole choir.”

<div class="clear-both">THE NORTH TRANSEPT.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the angle of the south transept in front of the great
south-east pier of the crossing is the famous statue of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
<strong>Virgin and Child</strong>, which, in Notre Dame, occupies a place
not unlike the far more famous and more venerable statue of
S. Peter in the vast basilica which at Rome is dedicated to
him. Mr. Belloc has used a photograph of it as the frontispiece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
to the volume quoted in the footnote, and he writes of it as
follows: “But of all the additions to the interior of Notre
Dame which popular fancy or the traditions of some crisis
give it, none is more worthy of being known than that which
alone survives of them, and which I have made the frontispiece
of this book. It is not that the statue has&mdash;as so much of
the fourteenth century can boast&mdash;a peculiar beauty; it is
indeed (when seen from below, as it was meant to be) full
of a delicacy that the time was adding to the severity of
the thirteenth century; it has from that standpoint a very
graceful gesture; the exaggeration of the forehead disappears,
the features show the delicate and elusive smile that the
fourteenth century always gave to its Madonnas, and there
appears also in its general attitude the gentle inclination of
courtesy and attention that was also a peculiar mark of a
statuary which was just escaping the rigidity of Early Gothic.
But its beauty, slight and ill-defined, is not, I repeat, the
interest of the statue. It is because this image dates from the
awakening of the capital to its position in France, because it
is the symbol of Paris, that it rises up alone, as you may see
it now, where the southern transept comes into the nave,<a name="FNanchor-13" id="FNanchor-13"></a><a href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a> all
lit with candles and standing out against the blue and the
lilies. It is a kind of core and centre to the city, and is, as it
were, the genius catching up the spirit of the wars, and giving
the generation of the last siege and reconstruction, as it will
give on in the future to others in newer trials, a figure in
which all the personality of the place is stored up and
remembered. It was made just at the outbreak of the
Hundred Years’ War, it received the devotion of Etienne
Marcel, it heard the outcry that followed the defeat of
Poictiers and the captivity of the king.” Mr. Belloc concludes:
“It has been for these five hundred years and more
the middle thing, carrying with full meaning the name ‘Our
Lady of Paris,’ which seems to spread out from it to the
Church, and to overhang like an influence the whole city, so
that one might wonder sometimes as one looked at it whether
it was not the figure of Paris itself one saw.”</p>

</div>

<p>In front of the statue is an iron grille terminating in spikes
for candles. After Poitiers, the citizens of Paris annually
offered a gigantic candle to be burned in front of this statue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
in order that the ills which afflicted France might cease.
It was of the exact length of the walls of the capital itself,
and was of course coiled up ropewise. The first presentation
was made on August 14th, 1437. The candle necessarily
grew with every increase in the area of the city. By the
beginning of the seventeenth century it was felt that the limits
of vastness had been reached, and in 1605 a silver lamp,
which was always to burn before the statue, was presented
instead of the candle. This was destroyed by the Revolutionists.
On the pillar below the statue is a sculpture said to represent
Eve with the serpent’s tail. The identity of the existing statue
with the original one so eloquently described by Mr. Belloc
has been doubted, but the grounds for doubt appear to be
small. In this transept are two marble slabs in memory
of seventy-five victims of the Commune.</p>

<p>The place on the north side, corresponding with the statue
of Notre-Dame de Paris on the south, is filled by a statue
of St. Denis, a fairly good work by Nicolas Coustou.<a name="FNanchor-14" id="FNanchor-14"></a><a href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a> The
splendid glass of the great rose window in the south transept
has in the main divisions of its four circles the twelve apostles,
and a host of bishops and saints with symbols and palms, to
whom angels bear golden crowns of glory. In one of the
small compartments St. Denis is represented carrying his head,
and in others are scenes from what is known as “les Combats
des Apôtres,” amongst them being the arrival of St. Matthew
in the presence of the King of Egypt, and the baptism of the
King after his conversion by the Apostle. The great rose
window of the opposite transept is devoted to scenes from
the life of the Virgin. She is represented with Christ in her
arms, and is surrounded with an army of patriarchs, judges,
prophets, priests and kings, all of whom are related to the
Saviour by ties of blood or as His spiritual forerunners.
The glass includes curious representations of the Antichrist,
decapitating Enoch; and of the destruction of the Antichrist
by the Almighty, who appears in a cloud. The small rose
or wheel windows in the sides of the transepts have been
filled with glass from designs by Steinheil. The pavement
of the transepts is of squares of black Bourbon marble
alternating with Dinan stone. Great attention was given by
Viollet-le-Duc to the polychromatic decoration of the transepts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
but it cannot be said that he has been more successful in these
parts of the church than elsewhere. The effect aimed at
appears to have been that of tapestry with simple patterns;
indeed, of the whole it is said, “cette décoration forme, jusque
sous les roses, une sort de brillante tapisserie.” Some of the
canopies are of the most intricate patterns, but they would
be better suited to wood or metal work than to painting. The
scheme includes a series of paintings by Perrodin of persons
distinguished in the history of the diocese of Paris. The
figures have elaborate decorative borders.</p>

<p>The removal of statues and memorials from the nave, which
we have already deplored, had just the shadow of a justification
from the purely æsthetic standpoint. Many of the monuments
were incongruous, some were positively grotesque. In Westminster
Abbey we have an example of the shocking effect of
inappropriate statuary in a Gothic building; we know, only
too well, how terribly one of the most beautiful interiors in
the world suffers from a crowd of tombs which are out of
keeping with the very spirit of the place. By the removal of
the memorials at Notre Dame, the church has doubtless regained
the aspect intended by its designers.</p>

<p>The nave leads uninterruptedly to the choir, which ends in
the high altar; and the high altar, with the adjacent shrine of
St. Marcel, was the primary reason of the existence of the
cathedral. We have seen that in its earlier form little or no
provision was made for chapels and consequently for side
altars. Everything was arranged to concentrate the eye on
the chief altar, and to lend dignity to its position. Its sacred
character was respected even in the far-off days in which the
body of the church was used for commercial purposes, or for
festivals the reverse of religious.</p>

<p>The great eastern limb of the church is raised above the
transepts by three steps. Once we have passed into the
<strong>Ambulatory</strong>, or <i>pourtour</i>, of the choir, we are in the most
interesting part of the building; for here our story is of
historical monuments and decorative objects still happily
existing, and not an account of things which have long since
ceased to be. When we step into the ambulatory, we pass
from newer to older work, but we experience no violent
transition from one style to another. The style of the choir
is, speaking generally, the style of the whole church. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
differences, interesting as they are to the minute student of
architectural development, are such as would remain unnoticed
by those who do not pretend to special knowledge. This
unity reminds one of an Italian Romanesque basilica rather
than a Gothic cathedral. Viollet-le-Duc has noted that the
capitals in the triforium of the choir seem to be earlier in
date than those of the main arcade beneath it; that if nothing
were left save the capitals of the two parts, one would
conclude that those of the triforium were earlier. This is
manifestly impossible, but it shows that not the smallest
deviation of style was allowed in constructing the upper
story.</p>

<p>Among the capitals of the columns in the choir there are
a few representations of animal life amongst the conventional
foliage, while the capitals in the nave represent foliage alone.
The choir is throughout a shade nearer Romanesque than
the nave, but the difference is so slight that only close
examination reveals it. Already we have remarked on the
superiority of an apsidal termination to any other form in
a Gothic church. The ordered grandeur of Notre Dame is
nowhere more impressive than in the beautiful sweep of the
apse with its spacious ambulatory. It must have been even
more imposing in its simplicity before the construction of
the side chapels was undertaken, although we are far from
regretting an addition which, though it may have reduced
the original dignity of the church, has added variety to it
and rendered it more interesting.</p>

<p>Let us begin our detailed examination of the choir and its
chapels with the famous <strong>Screen</strong> of sculptures by Jehan Ravy
and his nephew Jehan le Bouteiller, which we must study from
the ambulatory. In his <i>History of Sculpture</i>, Professor Wilhelm
Lübke devotes considerable space to this series in the chapter
devoted to “Northern Sculpture in the Late Gothic Epoch”
(1300 to 1450). After stating that France exhausted herself
during the golden age of Gothic sculpture, and that the period
under discussion was so stormy as to be unfavourable to the
production of works of art, he writes of the screen as follows:</p>

<p>“One of the most important works of the epoch [the end
of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth centuries]
are the extensive reliefs which cover the choir screen in the
interior of the Cathedral of Paris. These are only the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
of the formerly far richer plastic ornament which, in a great
measure, fell a sacrifice under Louis XIV. to a vain love of
ostentation. The earlier series on the north side contains
a crowded representation in an unbroken line of the History
of Christ; from the Annunciation to the Prayer at Gethsemane.
These representations are vividly conceived, and the style in
which they are executed breathes the spirit of the thirteenth
century. Perhaps they belong to the end of that century or
to the beginning of the next. The reliefs on the south side
are different in many points. They continue the History
of Christ; and, indeed, the whole was so arranged that the
cycle which began at the east passed along the north side to
the west end of the choir, and was continued on the lectern,<a name="FNanchor-15" id="FNanchor-15"></a><a href="#Footnote-15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a>
where the Passion, Crucifixion and Resurrection were depicted
in front of the congregation, concluding at the south side in
a scene moving from west to east. Of the latter scenes, the
only ones now in existence are those which extend from the
Meeting of Christ as the Gardener with Mary Magdalen to
the Farewell to the Disciples after the Resurrection. The artist
of these later scenes left his name, in an inscription that has
now disappeared,<a name="FNanchor-16" id="FNanchor-16"></a><a href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> as Jehan Ravy, who for twenty-six years
conducted the building of Notre Dame, at the end of which
time it was completed under his nephew Master Jehan de
Bouteiller, in 1351. Master Ravy evidently thought that he
could improve upon his predecessor’s work on the north side;
for while the latter had combined the scenes into one unbroken
series, he divided his into separate compartments by arcades,
so that these later representations, which are still in existence,
are separated from each other by small columns. In so doing
he followed the general taste of the century, which was inclined
to exchange a picturesque character for the calm epic relief
of the former period. While, however, his somewhat short
figures are certainly superior in correctness to the figures of
the north side, owing to his understanding of the physical
structure and to the neatness of execution, there is in the
figures of the north side a fresher tone of feeling and more grace
of action, compared with which the far more constrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
attitudes of the later works form an unpleasing contrast, and
even occasionally degenerate into commonplaceness. Thus in
these works, in spite of all expenditure of artistic care, there
is an unmistakable decline of creative power.”</p>

<p>The series on the north side should be visited first.
The scenes are fourteen in number, and have reference to
the Visitation:</p>

<li>The Shepherds and the Star of Bethlehem;</li>
<li>The Nativity;</li>
<li>The Visit of the Magi;</li>

<li>The Entry into Jerusalem;</li>
<li>The Last Supper;</li>
<li>Christ Washing the Feet of St. Peter;</li>
<li>The scene in the Garden of Olives.</li>
</ul>

<p>The later works on the south side, in which Professor Lübke
traces a decline of creative force, represent:</p>

<ul class="nobullet2">
<li>The Meeting of Christ as the Gardener with Mary Magdalen;</li>
<li>The Holy Women (the Three Maries) Kissing the Saviour’s Feet;</li>
<li>Jesus appearing to the Apostles (who are represented in a turreted building);</li>
<li>The Disciples of Emmaus, with Christ among them;</li>
<li>The Breaking of the Bread;</li>
<li>Another version of Christ Appearing to the Apostles;</li>
<li>The Doubt and the Conversion of St. Thomas;</li>
<li>The Miraculous Draught of Fishes;</li>
<li>Christ’s Message to the Apostles to Preach the Gospel to all Nations.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is extremely fortunate that these very interesting
sculptures have been left to us, for they constitute incomparably
the most important of the internal decorations at Notre
Dame, which, as we have seen, is relatively poor in the
mediæval tombs which are the glory of Westminster Abbey.
While we are thankful for what is left, we cannot help feeling
a grudge against Cardinal de Noailles, who caused some of the
scenes to be removed, and thus left the series incomplete.
That the modern restoration of the painting of the sculpture
was wise can hardly be maintained.<a name="FNanchor-17" id="FNanchor-17"></a><a href="#Footnote-17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a></p>

<div>VIEW OF THE CHOIR AT THE END OF THE XIII. CENTURY, SHOWING
THE CARVED ROOD-SCREEN AND THE SHRINE OF ST. MARCEL.<br />
(<i>From Viollet-le-Duc.</i>)</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For the moment we will leave the ambulatory, and consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the <strong>Choir and Sanctuary</strong>. It will be interesting, before
we examine the present state of these parts, to sketch briefly
their aspect in the fourteenth century. Corrozet and De
Breul have left us descriptions which have been illustrated
and elucidated by the indefatigable Viollet-le-Duc. The
entrance to the choir at the crossing was filled by a magnificent
screen of stone richly adorned with carving. This was about
eighteen feet high. The top formed the rood-loft, which was
approached by two circular staircases placed at either end of
the screen. In the centre was, of course, the entrance to
the choir. When the doors were open the high altar could
be seen from the end of the nave. Over this door was a
decorated gable terminating in a great crucifix. According to
De Breul this crucifix was a masterpiece of sculpture, as were
the other statues which composed the group. The loft was
broad, and had on both sides an open stone parapet, on which
were placed carved lecterns. The west front of the screen
had sculptured scenes of the Passion, which formed part of
the series by Jehan Ravy and Jehan de Bouteiller lately described.
On either side of the doorway, beneath the sculptures,
were small altars. The choir-stalls of carved wood occupied
much the same place as do those which we see to-day.
Between the rows of stalls were low tombs with recumbent
figures. The Sanctuary, approached by steps, was railed off,
and filled the apse. The space between the columns was
filled by a screen with carved scenes, which rose almost to
the level of the bases of the capitals. The altar was low, and
of stone, and possessed a re-table on which was placed a
cross. Enclosing it on all sides, save that towards the church,
was a screen with hangings of tapestry. At the four corners
of this screen were tall figures of angels. Immediately behind
the altar, and towering over it, was the shrine of St. Marcel, a
lofty open structure of brass and other metals in two stages,
ending in a gable at the apex of which rose a crucifix.</p>

<p>On the first stage, so that it could be seen from all parts
of the choir, was the feretrum or reliquary of St. Marcel.
This chief shrine had on its side shrines of less importance,
while, in the background to the north, was the small altar of
the Trinity, on which was placed the reliquary of Notre Dame,
containing portions of the dress and other relics of the mother
of Christ. A few fine tombs were also in the sanctuary, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
not far away was a bronze statue of Eudes de Sully. An
illustration, partly conjectural, of the choir and sanctuary in
the condition which I have attempted to describe from
Viollet-le-Duc’s <i>Dictionnaire</i>, is reproduced here. It will be
seen that while the furniture and ornament of this part of
the church is sufficiently splendid, it is nevertheless simple.
There would be ample space for the due performance of the
great ceremonials which constantly took place. Such was the
appearance of the choir and sanctuary until Louis XIV., in
fulfilment of the vow of Louis XIII., who had dedicated
himself and his kingdom to the Virgin, began his transformation.</p>

<p>The <strong>Choir</strong> is raised above the body of the church by three
steps, and on the right and left hand is enclosed by a low
<i>grille</i> in wrought iron with gilding. This rests on a stone
foundation, and is terminated towards the centre by two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
massive columns, on which are hung the gates, which are of
very beautiful design, representing conventionalised foliage and
flowers. At the top of the gate, in the centre, is a foliated
cross. The two bays on the south side of the choir nearest
the entrance have the same arrangement of a small pointed
window with a rose window beneath it, as exists in the side
of the transept immediately adjacent. The remaining windows
are in the altered and enlarged form, and the triforium of the
choir is similar to, though of earlier date than, that which runs
round the nave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
The <strong>Stalls</strong> occupy three bays on either side of the choir.
The erection of these stalls is part of the work undertaken
by order of Louis XIV. in accomplishment of his father’s
vow, and it follows that they are not in character with the
architecture of the choir. It was once proposed that for this
reason new stalls of “Gothic” design should take their place.
There is little likelihood of this being done now. Incongruity
among things beautiful in themselves is by no means a
calamity, and we may fairly question alike the taste and the
learning of those who crave for uniformity at all cost. One
is glad to think that Viollet-le-Duc never for a moment
contemplated the banishment of these stalls, which are a
particularly fine example of the best work of which the
craftsmen of the time were capable. The stalls have been
rearranged since they were first placed in the choir, and their
number has diminished. Originally there were one hundred
and fourteen stalls; now there are ten less. They are divided
on each side into upper and lower tiers, each tier having
twenty-six seats. The carvings are the work of Jean Nel and
Louis Marteau, the designs being supplied by Jean de
Goulon. The designer and the executants have combined to
produce a really admirable piece of work, of which a full
account is given in a very careful monograph, published by
Chouvet in Paris in 1855, entitled <i>Album des Boiseries
sculptées du Chœur de Notre Dame de Paris</i>. In this volume
the carvings are dealt with one by one, and their merits
intelligently discussed. At the back of the upper row of stalls
are eight large carved panels, which represent scenes in the
life of the Virgin. At the west end of the stalls are placed,
opposite to one another, the throne of the archbishop and
a similar throne for the dean of the chapter. These thrones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
or seats have elaborately-carved canopies. The relief on the
back of the chair or throne on the right represents the cure
of Childebert I. by St. Germain, Bishop of Paris. On the
opposite chair is represented in similar style the martyrdom
of St. Denis. Throughout the entire cathedral, in sculpture,
in stained glass, in carving, the Virgin is glorified, and next to
her in honour comes St. Denis. The stalls are lighted by
lamps in metal brackets, and the choir itself is illuminated
by handsome candelabra similar to those in the nave. In the
second bay on the north side of the choir is a small organ
used in the daily offices.</p>

<p>Close by this organ the stones of the pavement are movable,
and cover the entrance of a small crypt. This is the principal
subterranean chamber of the cathedral, and it was constructed
so recently as the eighteenth century. It was set apart as the
burial place of the Archbishops of Paris, and is little more
than a vault. Over the coffins of those of the Archbishops
who have been Cardinals are suspended their red hats and
tassels. The excavations for this little crypt led to a discovery
which was of great interest to archæologists. Amongst other
Roman remains was a small altar to Jupiter, which is now
preserved in the Cluny Museum. In <i>Paris à travers les Ages</i>
we read of a small crypt below the Chapelle S. Anne, on the
south side of the nave. Used now as a coal cellar, it was
formerly a burial place, as is attested by the following
inscription: “Cave pour les cercueils de plomb; cave pour
la sépulture des chanoines; caves pour la sépulture des
musiciens, enfants de Chœurs et officiers clercs.”</p>

<p>The pavement of the choir is of pieces of marble of various
colours, which together form a geometrical pattern. As
one looks at it, one laments the magnificent tombs with
bronze effigies which were formerly the glory of this part of
the church.</p>

The <strong>Sanctuary</strong> is approached by four steps of Languedoc
marble, and three additional steps of the same material
lead to the high altar. The <strong>High Altar</strong> still retains most
of the leading features of the arrangement of Louis XIV.
It was begun in 1699, and finished in 1714. The pseudo-classical
architecture by means of which the great pillars of
the apse were hidden has of course been swept away. The
principal group of sculpture, representing the Descent from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Cross, is by Nicolas Coustou, who was born at Lyons in 1658.
He was a pupil of Coysevox, his uncle, who at that time was
director of the Academy of Painting and Sculpture at Paris.
He obtained the <i>grand prix</i>, and went to study at Rome, where
he was profoundly influenced by the work of Michael Angelo.
Coustou’s output on his return to France was enormous.
The “Descent from the Cross,” at Notre Dame was doubtless
inspired by the famous group by Michael Angelo in St. Peter’s
at Rome. It cannot be said that Coustou has approached the
greatest of the Italians in the profundity of his pathos or in
tragic solemnity, but the group at Notre Dame is not without
decided merit, although it leans towards the melodramatic
and artificial.</p>

<p>On one side of the altar is a kneeling statue of Louis XIII.
by Guillaume Coustou, and on the other a similar statue of
Louis XIV. by Antoine
<a name="Coysevox" id="Coysevox"></a><ins title="Original has 'Coyevox'">Coysevox</ins>.
Guillaume Coustou was
the younger brother of Nicolas, and like him studied at Rome.
He represents Louis XIII. offering his crown and sceptre,
which he holds in his hands, to the Virgin. The statue of
Louis XIV. suggests the accomplishment of his father’s vow.
Coysevox, from whose chisel it came, was the leading French
sculptor of his time. He was born at Lyons in 1640, and
died in 1720. The statues of angels bearing the instruments
of the Passion are by various sculptors. The angel with the
crown of thorns and that carrying the reed are by Corneille
Van Clève. The angel with the nails is by Claude Poirier;
that with the sponge by Simon Hurtrelle; that with the scroll
by Laurent Magnier; and that with the lance by Anselme
Flamen. The bas-relief in bronze-gilt in front of the altar
represents the Entombment, and is by Van Clève. The
cross and candelabra formerly belonged to the cathedral of
Arras. The lectern of sculptured bronze is dated 1755, and
has on its base the name of Duplessis, founder to the King.
A superb example of Gobelins tapestry, the gift of Napoleon I.,
is used on great festivals to cover the floor of the sanctuary.
The pavement is partly in mosaic, and has a representation
of the arms of France.</p>

<p>The comparatively new stained glass of the choir and apse
is not so bad as one might expect. It is by Maréchal of
Metz. The central window of the apse is devoted to the
Visitation. To the right are Eudes de Sully and St. Marcel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
St. Augustine and St. Jerome; St. Luke and St. John;
Daniel and Jeremiah; David and Abraham; St. George and
St. Martin; Charlemagne and Pope Leo. III.; and St. Hilaire
and St. Irénée. To the right the subjects are St. Denis and
Maurice de Sully; St. Gregory and St. Ambrose; St. Mark and
St. Matthew; Ezekiel and Isaiah; Aaron and Melchisedec;
St. Stephen and St. Laurent, St. Louis and St. Gregory VII.,
and St. Remi and St. Martin. The small rose windows of
the choir, like those of the transept, are filled with glass by
Steinheil. The choir, more perhaps than any other part of
the cathedral, has suffered from the wholesale destruction
of glass which has already been described. Visitors to the
cathedral of Chartres can estimate the value of mediæval
glass in a Gothic cathedral. It is unfortunate that the great
windows of the clerestory at Paris were filled up before the
notable revival in the art of stained glass, which commenced
in England, and has now extended to France.</p>

<p>We must now return to the Ambulatory and the adjacent
chapels. It is in this part of the church that Viollet-le-Duc’s
decorations are most profuse, and it is not possible to consider
them successful. It is quite probable that no such scheme
of decoration could be open to fewer objections than that
of Viollet-le-Duc. The truth is that the colour confuses our
appreciation of the fine lines of the architecture, and it is
frequently restless and irritating where it should be most
reposeful.</p>

<p><strong>The Chapels of the Choir.</strong> On the south side are the
following chapels:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Chapelle Saint-Denis.</i> The chief object of interest here
is a statue, by Auguste de Bay, of Archbishop Affre, who is
represented at the moment when he made his heroic appearance
on the barricade of the Faubourg Saint Antoine with
an olive branch. This was on June 25th, 1848, during the
Commune. The Archbishop was struck by a ball and killed.</p>

<p><i>Chapelle Sainte-Madeleine.</i> This chapel contains the grave
of the Papal nuncio Garibaldi, Archbishop of Myra, who
died in 1853. Archbishop
<a name="Sibour" id="Sibour"></a><ins title="Original has 'Sibor'">Sibour</ins>,
who was murdered in the
church of St. Etienne du Mont on Jan. 8th, 1857, by a
priest, is commemorated by a kneeling statue in marble by
Dubois.</p>

<p><i>Chapelle Saint-Guillaume.</i> The statue of the Virgin seated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
with the Child Jesus in her arms, is attributed to Bernini, who
came from Rome to Paris during the reign of Louis XIV. to
make alterations and additions to the Louvre. The Mausoleum
of Henri-Charles d’Harcourt, Lieutenant-general of the armies
of the King, who died in 1769, is a pretentious and theatrical
work which was once highly esteemed. It is by the sculptor
Pigalle, and is of white marble. The widow who kneels by
the tomb and appears to be calling her husband is warned
away by a figure of Death. The genius of War is represented
lamenting, and the whole is completed by trophies of arms.</p>

<p><i>Chapelle Saint-Georges.</i> Amongst the elaborate mural decorations
of this chapel is a picture by Steinheil of St. George
and the Dragon. The statue of Archbishop Darboy is by
Bonnassieux. The prelate is represented falling amidst the
bullets of the Communists, whom he blesses as he dies. This
tragic incident took place in the prison of La Roquette, on
May 27th, 1871. Close by is a kneeling statue of Archbishop
Morlot (<i>d.</i> 1862) by Lescorné. The chapel also contains a
statue of St. George by the same artist.</p>

<p>The following are the chapels on the <i>north</i> side of the
choir:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>La Chapelle de Notre Dame des Sept Douleurs</i>, or
<i>La Chapelle du Petit Chœur</i>. The bas-reliefs over the
altar represent the angel appearing to the Virgin Mary, the
Descent from the Cross, and the Entombment. The statue in
wood of Notre Dame des Sept Douleurs is by Corbon. The
compositions, in six panels, by Perrodin, represent: Jesus
bearing the Cross; Christ on Calvary; the Descent from the
Cross; the Communion of the Virgin; and the Death of the
Virgin. The nine carved wood stalls are of the same period
as those of the choir. They were possibly part of the original
series, which, as we have seen, was reduced in number. At all
events, the details indicate that the same designer and craftsmen
were employed on them. This chapel contains the only
important fragment of the original polychromatic decoration
with which the walls of the cathedral were anciently embellished.
It consists of a mural painting dating from the fourteenth
century. In the centre is represented the Virgin enthroned
with the Child. To the right is St. Denis, and on the left
Bishop Simon Matiffas de Buci, who built the three chapels
on the left of the apse. Beneath the picture was formerly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Bishop’s tomb. Below the representation of the Virgin and
Child is a curious design representing angels bearing away
a human soul. This painting was unfortunately restored by
M. Maillot the elder, and has consequently lost much of its
antiquarian interest.</p>

<p><i>Chapelle Saint-Marcel.</i> Pierre Deseine’s enormous monument
to Cardinal de Belloy fills a large part of this chapel.
The cardinal is represented giving alms to two orphan girls.
St. Denis looks on, and records the cardinal’s name on a list
of the bishops of Paris noted for their charity. Close by
is the tomb, with reclining figure, of Monseigneur de Quelen,
by De Chaume. Amongst the mural decorations of this
chapel the chief is a large painting by Maillot the younger.
The subject is the “Translation of the relics of St. Marcel from
the old Church of St. Marie to the Church of Notre Dame
by Bishop Eudes de Sully.” The personages represented are
portraits of the officials of the diocese, and include Archbishop
Darboy and the Abbé la Place. In the vaulting is a design
representing the Coronation of St. Marcel.</p>

<p><i>Chapelle Saint-Louis.</i> This chapel has six statues in wood
by Corbon, representing Christ, the Virgin, St. John, St. Denis,
St. Rustiguex, and St. Eleutherius. The kneeling statue of
Archbishop Louis-Antoine de Noailles, who died in 1729, is
by De Chaume.</p>

<p><i>Chapelle Saint-Germain.</i> Tomb of Archbishop
<a name="Leclerc" id="Leclerc"></a><ins title="Original has 'Leclercq'">Leclerc</ins>
de Juigné (died 1811), a kneeling figure in relief. The tomb
was repaired by Viollet-le-Duc, who modified its original
design.</p>

<p><i>Chapelle Saint-Ferdinand.</i> Monument of Archbishop de
Beaumont (died 1781), from designs by Viollet-le-Duc.</p>

<p><i>Chapelle Saint-Martin.</i> Monument of Jean-Baptiste de
Vardes, Comte de Guébriant, Marshal of France, who died
in 1643, and of his wife Renée du Bec Crespin. A splendid
service was celebrated in Notre Dame on the Marshal’s death.
His wife was sent to Poland as ambassadress extraordinary,
and died there in 1643, without being able to erect a monument
to her husband. The Marquis de Vardes erected the
tomb, which was practically destroyed during the Revolution.
It was renewed from designs by Viollet-le-Duc.</p>

<p>Behind the Sanctuary is the tomb with a jewelled effigy of
Archbishop Matiffas de Buci, who died in 1304. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
removed from La Chapelle de Notre Dame des Sept Douleurs.
In the arcading below the bas-reliefs of Jehan Revy and Jean
le Bouteiller are placed little brasses with the names, arms,
and date of the death of the persons whose remains are buried
at Notre Dame. A list of the most interesting of these has
already been given.</p>

<span>CONCLUSION. THE SACRISTY, ETC.</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Notre Dame</span> was within comparatively recent times surrounded
with streets so narrow that vehicular traffic was
impossible. Amongst the most characteristic were the Rue
de Glatigny and the Rue de Marmousets, which, as late as
1865, preserved the dimensions, and something of the aspect,
of a side street in the middle ages. The <i>quartier</i> thus
intersected literally teemed with churches of which nothing
remains. Amongst them perhaps the most important were
those dedicated to Saint-Landry, Sainte-Geneviève des Ardents,
Saint-Pierre aux Bœufs, Saint-Aguan, Saint-Marine, Saint-Luc,
Saint-Jean le Rond, Saint-Denis au Pays and Saint-Christophe.
None of them appear to have been large, and of some the
origin and history remain obscure.</p>

<p>On the south side of the Cathedral stood the <i>Palais
Episcopal</i>, which was constructed by Maurice de Sully and
added to by Matiffas de Bucy and other prelates. On
Feb. 14th, 1831, it was attacked by the mob, and five
hours sufficed for its complete destruction. The contents
included a library of 20,000 volumes, a collection of 1,500<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
manuscripts, those of the ancient archives of the church, which
escaped the Revolutionists, a fine collection of pictures, and
priceless works of art of an ecclesiastical character. These
were thrown into the Seine, burned, or stolen.</p>

<p>The
<a name="Cloitre" id="Cloitre"></a><ins title="Original has 'Cloîture'"><strong>Cloître</strong></ins>
or Cloister of Notre Dame was on the
north side and at the east end of the church. It is difficult
to say what was its early aspect, but in the sixteenth century
and afterwards it in no way resembled the cloister of a
monastery, but consisted of an agglomeration of separate
houses. It was in the nature of a College of Secular
Canons. It was similar to the Temple in London in that it
possessed gates of its own, which shut it off from the rest of
the city. The Cloister contained thirty-seven houses for the
canons of the Cathedral, who were allowed to have living with
them their near female relatives. No other women, lay or
religious, were allowed to sleep in the cloister. The tedious
Rue du Cloître Notre-Dame occupies a portion of the space
on which the Cloister stood.</p>

<p><strong>The Sacristy</strong> was formerly a part of the Palais Episcopal.
It had been rebuilt by Soufflot, whose work was
partially destroyed in 1831. A new sacristy has been constructed
by Viollet-le-Duc in the style of the thirteenth century.
The exterior is richly ornamented with statues and pinnacles.
It communicates with the south ambulatory of the choir by
means of two covered passages, one of which leads into the
<i>Sacristie du Chapitre</i>, which contains a large hall, the
room of the Chapter above, which is the cathedral treasury,
and a vestry for the canons. The great hall has stained glass
windows in which bishops of Paris are represented.</p>

<p>It contains a crucifix and two statuettes by Corbon, a fine
<i>armoire</i> decorated with paintings of scenes in the life of
St. Denis. There are pictures in various parts of the building
by Vaulos, Salvator Rosa, Lebrun, Louis Testelin, Charles
Poerson and others, but none of them are of much note.
A picturesque little cloister, with a fountain in the middle
surmounted by a crucifix, is one of the agreeable features
of the building. Its eastern arcade is glazed, the windows
representing scenes in the life of Ste. Geneviève.</p>

<p><strong>The Treasury</strong>, once endowed with enormous riches, was
despoiled at the Revolution of all but a few objects of value.
There still remains the reputed Crown of Thorns (supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
to have been given to St. Louis), brought hither from La
Sainte Chapelle. The so-called Nail of the True Cross
formerly belonged to the royal abbey of St. Denis. These
relics are only exposed on Fridays in Lent. The reliquaries
are for the most part imitations of those which were formerly
in La Sainte Chapelle. Perhaps the most interesting of the
objects exhibited is a gold cross, probably of twelfth-century
workmanship. It belonged to the Emperor Manuel Comnenus,
and was bequeathed by the Princess Anne de Gonzague to the
church of St. Germain des
<a name="Pres" id="Pres"></a><ins title="Original has 'Près'">Prés</ins>
in 1863. In addition there
are the relic of the True Cross sent to Bishop Galon in 1109,
from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem; the
“discipline” of St. Louis; the crozier in copper and wood of
Bishop Eudes de Sully; the crucifix used by St. Vincent-de-Paul
at the death-bed of Louis XIII.; the pastoral cross of
Archbishop Affre; a silver image of the Virgin and Child
presented in 1821 by Charles X.; the <i>ostensoir</i> given by
Napoleon I., and services of plate presented by the same monarch
and by Napoleon III. The vestments are very magnificent,
and include the coronation mantle of Napoleon I. and the
chasuble worn by Pope Pius VI. when he crowned him.
The <i>soutanes</i> worn by Archbishops Affre, Sibour, and Darboy
in their last moments, marked by the instruments which produced
their violent deaths, have a tragic interest.</p>

<p>The somewhat obtrusively picturesque modern building
to the west of the Sacristy is known as the <i>Presbytère</i>. It
has been often ridiculed, and at times rather fiercely denounced,
but if any building was to be erected on the site, it seems
difficult to imagine anything less offensive. It is pleasing
and unpretentious, and contrasts only too favourably with the
dull houses of the Rue du
<a name="Cloitre2" id="Cloitre2"></a><ins title="Original has 'Cloîture'">Cloître</ins>
Notre-Dame, which are
as undistinguished as they well can be.</p>

<p>The space at the back of the Cathedral is laid out as a garden.
This is modern and somewhat formal, but it affords a fine view
of the east end, and constitutes a welcome oasis of trees and
grass in a grey waste of commonplace buildings. In the centre
is a fountain with a statue of the Virgin and Child, and
fragments of sculpture and carving taken from the church at
different times lie about. The reader who wishes to understand
at a glance the various changes which have taken place
in that part of the French metropolis which lies in the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
shadow of the cathedral should refer to the second volume of
the magnificent work <i>Paris à travers les Ages</i>, in which a
plan of the district in 1881 is compared with conjectural plans
of the same in the years 1150, 1550, and 1750.</p>

<p>The huge open space west of the cathedral is the Place
du Parvis Notre-Dame. This oblong <i>place</i> far exceeds the
church itself in area, and gives to the west front a somewhat
dwarfed appearance. On the left-hand side (looking east)
is the vast Hotel Dieu, the modern name of the hospital,
known as the Maison Dieu, which for centuries has been
associated with Notre Dame. The present building was only
completed in 1877. It is from the designs of M. Diet, and is
by no means of an ornamental character, although the total cost
was 36,400,000 francs. On the west side of the Place du
Parvis are the barracks of the Garde Republicaine. Close
to them is one of those open-air flower markets which are
so charming and characteristic a feature of the Paris of
to-day.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
